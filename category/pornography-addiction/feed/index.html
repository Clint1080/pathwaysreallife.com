With the right counseling, these self-destructive habits can be replaced by more positive behavior patterns, and fortunately, this advice is now widely available. But there are also practical things you can do to help yourself.</p>
<p><span id="more-4592"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Use Content Control Software</strong></h2>
<p>One of the first things to consider is using web protection software. Parents often use these types of parental controls to protect their kids from exposure to particular websites. There are many options to choose from and even free options. It would be recommended to have someone else set up a site blocker for you so you don’t know the password to override the software. It requires a certain amount of initial will power to install these systems, and then to maintain them on all your electronic devices, but the commitment to doing so is an important declaration of intent and a sign of determination to change.</p>
<h2><strong>Pay Attention to Your Environment and Adopt Healthy Habits</strong></h2>
<p>Like other addictions, the habitual and addictive use of pornography may be largely situational; so that <strong><em>the impulses driving it are primarily a response to external factors in an individual’s life which are causing unhappiness.</em></strong> It might be marriage or relationship problems, poor physical health, financial problems, employment problems, social isolation or just plain boredom. Whatever the cause of the pornography addiction, it’s essential to address the underlying cause if a lasting solution is to be achieved. This may require medical help, or professional counseling, but also needs the individual to take some responsibility for their recovery.</p>
<p>If social isolation and consequent boredom are the principal problems, this might involve joining a local group or club focused on other activities which you have enjoyed in the past to take up your time.</p>
<p>Regular exercise, particularly outdoors, can also have a powerful affect in improving your mood and will remove you from the temptations of your screen. It need not involve an expensive gym membership, it may be as simple as just be going for a walk or run.</p>
<p>There are many online resources <a title="Pornography Addiction - Overcoming Pornography Addiction - Pathways Real Life Recovery" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/pornography-addiction-utah/">addressing the issue of addiction to pornography</a> which may be helpful, and meeting groups such as Sex Addicts Anonymous, but for counseling to be effective it remains overwhelmingly important that you should commit fully to the process.</p>
<h2><strong>Consistent Desire for Change</strong></h2>
<p>Making the decision to change is essential, but maintaining the motivation to progress is equally important, and perhaps even more difficult. <strong><em>One powerful way to build this motivation is to reflect with gratitude on the good things in your daily life. </em></strong>Almost everyone, however difficult their current circumstances may seem, has some reason to be thankful and joyful.</p>
<p>Whether you want better health, to be more productive and financially successful at work, or to rebuild damaged close relationships; frequent reminders of your principal motivators can be very helpful.</p>
<h2><strong>Get Access to Experienced Professional Advice</strong></h2>
<p>If you have tried to <a title="Recovery Information - Overcoming Pornography Addiction - Pathways Real Life Recovery" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/steps-overcome-pornography-addiction/">quit watching pornography</a> and have been unsuccessful, specialized treatment and counseling may be needed.

Those caught in this cycle can <em>recognize the stages in their pornography viewing habits</em>. From the initial sexual thoughts, a feeling of fear and a desire to avoid watching are triggered; despite these feelings, <em>the compulsion to watch pornography is too great, leading to a sense of shame and guilt after watching</em>. While a person trapped in this cycle will vow to never watch pornography again, sexual thoughts recur and lead to another round of this pattern.</p>
<p><strong>If you recognize these symptoms of <a title="Utah Pornography Addiction Help - How to Overcome Pornography Addiction? - Signs of Pornography Addiction Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/pornography-addiction-utah/">pornography addiction</a> in yourself, here are the steps you can take to overcome your addiction.</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-4583"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Understanding Healthy Sexuality</strong></h2>
<p>The first step in <a title="Recovery Information - How to Overcome Pornography Addiction? - Signs of Pornography Addiction Utah " href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/3-tips-ending-pornography-addiction/">overcoming an addiction to pornography</a> is <em>recognizing what healthy sexuality looks like</em>. For those with a beneficial sexual outlook, their<em><strong> sexual expression is positive and enriching as they both give and receive</strong></em> while experiencing pleasure. This type of sexuality benefits the individual emotionally and spiritually as well as physically.</p>
<p><strong><em>In contrast,</em> an unhealthy sexuality involves a sense of shame around sexual thoughts</strong>, a feeling that one&#8217;s sexual energy is <em>uncontrollable</em> or a desire to use sex to exploit others through power or force in a way that is not consensual. In general, pornography addicts have this sexual outlook as they use pornography in order to feel <em>wanted</em>, <em>important</em>, or <em>powerful</em>.</p>
<h2><strong>Recognizing the Signs of Pornography Addiction</strong></h2>
<p>Common signs of an addition to pornography include <em><strong>increasing social isolation</strong></em>, <em><strong>defensiveness </strong></em>or<em><strong> guilt </strong></em>regarding your pornography usage, continued<em><strong> reliance on pornography </strong>despite the negative consequences</em>, a <em><strong>loss of control</strong></em> and<em> <strong>inability to stop</strong></em>, <em><strong>obsessive thoughts </strong></em>about pornography, and/or a<em><strong> strain in your relationship and intimacy with your partner.</strong></em></p>
<h2><strong>Identifying Your Personal Triggers</strong></h2>
<p>Pinpointing the physiological changes in your body that occur and induce you to give in to your pornography addiction <em>is an important part of recovery</em>. Many addicts experience similar symptoms as they feel a strong urge to view pornography or masturbate compulsively;<strong> these signs can include</strong><em><strong> increased blood pressure, a rapid pulse, shallow breathing and dilated pupils.</strong> Recognizing these changes in your body can provide you with important information that can help change your addictive behavior.</em></p>
<p>In short, by observing your normal pulse rate and breathing pattern, you will be able to recognize any changes that indicate that you may be about to lose control and give in to your pornography addiction. Similarly, by noticing a decrease in your heart beat and a return to normal breathing, you can acknowledge that your urges are passing. <em><strong>The observation of breathing is particularly important as it is the only subconscious function of our bodies that we are able to consciously control</strong></em>. By taking deep, slow and controlled breaths when you recognize that you are feeling the physical symptoms of a pornography craving, <em><strong>you can directly affect your subconscious mind and exert control over your addiction</strong></em>.</p>
<p>A simple controlled breathing exercise that you can use involves slowly breathing in, holding your breath, and breathing out to a count of 10 each time. Repeating this exercise 10 times can <em>help you control your response to your personal trigge</em>rs.</p>
<h2><strong>Treating the Underlying Causes</strong></h2>
<p><em>Understanding</em> and <em>addressing</em> any <em>underlying causes</em> that are contributing to your pornography addiction is an important step on the road to recovery. For many people,<strong> pornography and excessive internet use in general becomes a method to use to <em>self-soothe</em> in response to<em> depression, anxiety, stress, trauma, boredom </em>or<em> loneliness. </em></strong>Addressing these underlying causes can make overcoming your pornography addiction easier.</p>
<h3><strong>Seeking Effective Treatment for Pornography Addiction</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Finding the best treatment method <em>for you</em> is key to overcoming your addiction to pornography</strong>. Many people are helped by <em>Sex Addicts Anonymous</em>, a free support group similar to Alcoholics Anonymous. <strong>For those with <a title="Utah Pornography Addiction Help - How to Overcome Pornography Addiction? - Signs of Pornography Addiction Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/pornography-addiction-utah/">pornography addictions</a> who need specialized treatment and individualized attention, <a title="Pathways Real Life - How to Overcome Pornography Addiction? - Signs of Pornography Addiction Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/"><em>Pathways Real Life Recovery</em></a> in Utah offers the help you need.</strong> Our <em>open</em>, <em>accepting</em> and <em>non-shaming</em> atmosphere provides the <em>necessary support</em> required to <em>overcome</em> your pornography addiction, and our<em> customized treatment plans</em> can address your <em>unique needs</em> including co-occurring disorders. <strong>Please<em><a title="Contact Us - How to Overcome Pornography Addiction? - Signs of Pornography Addiction Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/contact/"> contact Pathways Real Life Recovery</a></em> today to receive a <em>free</em> consultation. </strong>Call us at<strong> 801-758-8489.</strong></p>
