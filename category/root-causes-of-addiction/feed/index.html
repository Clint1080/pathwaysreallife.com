While gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer and trans identity individuals are finding increased mainstream support and acceptance, as many as 65% commonly face anti-LGBTQ harassment and discrimination.</p>
<p><span id="more-5065"></span></p>
<p><strong><em>The effects of discrimination contribute to an alarmingly high rate of <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/drug-rehab-sandy-utah/">substance abuse</a>, <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/depression-treatment-utah/">depression</a>, and <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/utah-suicide-prevention/">suicide</a> among LGBTQ individuals.</em></strong> A staggering 40% of those who identify as transgender has reported attempting suicide. But as shocking as these statistics are, the future is becoming less bleak every day. <strong><em>Emerging mental health resources for LGBTQ people are becoming more attainable thanks to the tireless work of LGBTQ activists and increasing support of allies</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Your active support is critical for the mental wellness of your LGBTQ loved one. <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/"><strong>Pathways Real Life Recovery Center in Utah</strong></a> understands that<strong><em> acceptance from loved ones and active family support play a particularly important role to prevent suicide</em></strong>. Be a part of the solution and lend your support by becoming an LGBTQ ally. Here are 5 ways to support the <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/lgbtq-counselor-in-utah/">mental health of your LGBTQ loved ones</a>:</p>
<h2><strong>1. Stand Up for Your Loved One!</strong></h2>
<p>Becoming a true ally can make a big difference in the daily life of your LGBTQ loved one. Life is challenging for all of us, but LGBTQ people often face anti-LGBTQ words and actions that create difficult barriers even in seemingly simple circumstances. As allies, it is our job to <strong><em>stand up for our LGBTQ loved ones by calling out anti-LGBTQ behavior</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Educate other family members about acceptance by explaining LGBTQ identities and openly answering questions. Show your support at work by having your LGBTQ co-worker&#8217;s back and always call out discrimination. You can also <strong><em>make a difference by advocating for company or policy changes that will encourage acceptance and understanding</em></strong> like diversity training.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Respect Their Chosen Identity</strong></h2>
<p>Affirm the love and support for the LGBTQ people in your life by respecting how they choose to live their lives, who they choose to love and how they choose to be identified. <strong><em>Embrace their individual self-expression and stay away from pressuring them to conform.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Always use an individual&#8217;s personally chosen gender pronouns and encourage or correct others to do the same.</em></strong> Research shows that the risk of suicide is reduced for transgender youth whose communities affirm their chosen identities.</p>
<h2><strong>3. NEVER &#8216;Out&#8217; Your LGBTQ Loved One</strong></h2>
<p>Coming out isn&#8217;t just revealing sexual orientation or gender identity. For most people, coming out is a long and difficult process. Each individual will face different life circumstances that greatly influence their coming out experience. <strong><em>Another person should never assume that they understand the contributing factors of such a challenging and life-changing moment.</em></strong></p>
<p>While there is nothing shameful about being LGBTQ, openly expressing it &#8211; or not &#8211; is a highly personal choice. An individual has the right to facilitate their own terms about their identity and how open they wish to be, even if that differs greatly from one situation to the next. <strong><em>Make sure your LGBTQ loved one knows that you support their choices of expression and how they choose to share them.</em></strong></p>
<h2><strong>4. Confront Your Own Biases</strong></h2>
<p>You love and support your LGBTQ family and friends. But whether you are aware of it or not, <strong><em>we all have involuntary implicit biases that can cause us to react in a discriminatory manner</em></strong>. This unconscious discrimination has deep-seated influences that no one is immune to like gender, religion, and class.</p>
<p>While it is okay to make mistakes, it is important to acknowledge and confront implicit biases in ourselves in order to better support our LGBTQ loved ones. <strong><em>Recognizing our own assumptions about gender, family, love, sex, and intimacy will help us confront biases that normally would never even surface. </em></strong></p>
<p>Work on yourself to <strong><em>adjust the way you unconsciously think and feel to match your current level of love and understanding</em></strong> to be your LGBTQ loved one&#8217;s best ally!</p>
<h2><strong>5. Support and Help Them Access Mental Health Resources</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Support the mental health of your LGBTQ loved ones by being a good listener and making sure they know that you are there for them.</em></strong> You can help them find local resources for <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/our-services/">therapy and substance abuse treatment</a>, an <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/lgbtq-counselor-in-utah/">LGBTQ-friendly therapist</a> and make sure they know about the <strong><a href="https://www.glbthotline.org/national-hotline.html">LGBTQ National Help Center hotline</a>, 1-888-843-4564 </strong>to instantly connect with someone who cares.</p>

It may seem simple, but it feels different for the person with the addiction. Actions that seem easy from the outside (calling a rehab center, telling a coworker or boss about an addiction, or even admitting an addiction is present) may seem insurmountable to a person suffering from addiction.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4954"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><b><i>People struggling with addictions often ask for help indirectly, because they are ashamed or reluctant to admit they have an addiction, or because loved one feel addiction is a personal moral failing</i></b>. They may contact a friend or family member and ask for money or a place to stay when what they really need is a listening, patient ear, and direction for moving through and past an addiction. When speaking to a person with an addiction, take advantage of lucid moments and be reasonable.</span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s2">How to Encourage a Person with Addiction to Seek Help</span></h2>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">Be empathetic</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">Keep conversations general</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">Ask open-ended questions to get more information</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">Maintain healthy boundaries</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">Avoid disagreeing, arguing, or criticism</span></li>
<li class="li5"><span class="s2">Be concerned and show it</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">Direct the person toward accepting the existence of an addiction</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">Encourage responsibility in life</span></li>
<li class="li5"><span class="s2">Ask for help from other family, friends, or recovery centers like <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/our-services/"><span class="s6">Pathways</span></a></span></li>
</ul>
<h2>What To Do if An Addict Doesn’t Want Help</h2>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2">It’s very painful to see a friend, family member, loved one, or coworker struggling with a serious addiction and feel there is nothing you can do to help. You may wonder what will happen to that person; whether the person will lose their job, family, or home; or feel helpless. Addiction feels like this for everyone involved &#8212; especially the person with the addiction. <b><i>Take advantage of your position outside the pressures of addiction and do what you can to help</i></b>. Here are some suggestions if a person if your life doesn’t seem to want help when it is clearly needed.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">Don’t wait if you see addiction taking hold</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">Talk to a friend or family member who has struggled with addiction</span></li>
<li class="li5"><span class="s2">Call a <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/person-centered-and-solution-focused-therapy/"><span class="s6">solutions-oriented</span></a>, positive change recovery program</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Remember that, no matter how much you want to, you can’t make them quit; do the recovery work for them; or accept behavior that violates your personal boundaries.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='The Basics of Overdose' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/the-basics-of-overdose/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p><a href="http://www.health.utah.gov/vipp/topics/prescription-drug-overdoses/">According to the 2014 statistics</a> from the Utah Department of Health, 32% of Utah adults had been on prescribed opioid pain medication. Drug poisoning deaths in Utah have<strong><em> surpassed</em></strong> deaths due to other causes such as firearms, motor vehicle accidents, and falls. Misuse of addictive prescription medications such as opioids can result in<strong><em> personal and legal consequences</em></strong>. <strong><em>It is estimated that 23 Utahns die every month from prescription drug overdoses</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Here is an overdose 101 detailed look at the basics of overdose and <strong><em>what to do if someone overdoses.</em></strong> Below are some overdose basics to aid in understanding the topic better;</p>
<h2>What is an Overdose?</h2>
<p>A drug overdose occurs when one takes a drug or a combination of different medications above and beyond the prescribed limit. Overdose signs differ with the type of drug used. As such,<strong><em> it is vital to know the right amount and time of taking your medication to avoid an overdose</em></strong>.</p>
<p><span id="more-4920"></span></p>
<h3>Types of Drugs and Signs of Overdose</h3>
<h4>Opioids and Depressants</h4>
<p><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/why-is-heroin-so-addictive/"><em>Heroin</em></a> and other pharmaceutical opioids such as <em>Endone</em>, <em>benzodiazepines</em>, and <em>barbiturates</em> produce a calming effect by slowing down the central nervous system. <strong><em>Depressants</em></strong> <strong><em>slow down the vital activities of the body such as breathing and the heart rate</em></strong>. These substances can be prescribed to a patient who has a sleeping problem and for purposes of relieving pain. However, <strong><em>when taken in large amounts or mixed they can cause permanent brain damage and overdose</em></strong>, which will lead to depressing normal body functions such as breathing and eventual slowing down of the heart rate that can result in death.</p>
<h4>Alcohol</h4>
<p>Alcohol is used recreationally to produce a calming effect by slowing down the central nervous system. Although most people don’t consider extreme consumption of alcohol as an overdose, <strong><em>alcohol is a strong depressant</em></strong> that can lead to an overdose if consumed uncontrollably. For example, <strong><em>binge drinking can lead to acute alcohol poisoning</em></strong>.</p>
<h4>Stimulants</h4>
<p>An overdose of stimulants such as <em>amphetamines</em> can increase the <strong><em>risk of stroke and seizures.</em></strong></p>
<h2>Tolerance and Half-life</h2>
<p>It is possible to develop tolerance when using a drug regularly. Although a person who has developed tolerance will need more of the drug to get the same effect, he/she can also lose the tolerance if he doesn’t use the drug for a while. Also,<strong><em> if someone takes the usual amount of prescription medication after a break from using the drug, it could also lead to an overdose.</em></strong> That is why using drugs after periods of abstinence such as release from prison or after leaving a drug rehab center can cause an overdose.</p>
<p>Half-life is the time it takes for a particular drug’s strength or effect to drop to half of its original dose. Benzodiazepines drugs are known to have a longer half-life. In other words, <strong><em>if an individual used the drug yesterday, he/she may still have enough in the system to get an overdose, if the same drug is used today</em></strong>.</p>
<h2>Drug Overdose First Aid</h2>
<p>Drug overdose symptoms depend on a range of factors, such as medical history, type of drug used and amount of drug taken. <strong><em>Don’t assume someone who has overdosed is asleep because it can take several hours for someone who has overdosed to die</em></strong>. This is a medical emergency that necessitates <strong><em><u>immediate medical attention</u></em></strong>. Call an ambulance, if you suspect that someone has a drug overdose.</p>

In 2015, they proposed the <strong>drug mitigation strategy</strong> aimed at setting aside funds for treatment and prevention. The approach notes, “substance abuse is not only a criminal offense but also a public concern.” Past researchers have shown that addiction is both treatable and preventable as any other disease.”</p>
<p>Despite the growing support for the compassionate approach in combating drug addition, there is a strong need to change how we treat addicts. In most cases, we focus on what meets the eye, judging them as weak and immoral instead of identifying real problem behind their actions.</p>
<p>The following are three wrong approaches we use to punish addicts that need to stop.</p>
<h2>Defining Addiction as Criminal Behavior</h2>
<p>Addiction is a health issue, not a criminal one. When we put an addict in jail for minor crimes such as possession, much less for getting a felony for minor crimes, we inhibit their resources toward finding employment and housing in order to lead a successful life.<strong><em> Addicts commit crimes because they have no other resources available to treat their addiction, certainly not because addicts themselves are inherently criminal in their behavior. Jail time drains the taxpayer instead of helping addicts recover, and jail is not a good environment to find help.</em></strong> The funds used for incarceration and criminal activity if used to treat them could save billions. Moreover, it makes them accountable for their actions reducing their chances of going back to drugs.</p>

<h2>Treatment Paradigms</h2>
<p>A popular treatment program is the 12 Steps approach. For some people, it does treat the symptoms of addiction, but it also leads to a false conclusion as to how the illness itself should be approached. The problem with 12 Steps is it forces the addict to relinquish personal responsibility rather than allowing them to understand what the disease entails and learn appropriate measures to deal with it.</p>
<h2>Disallowing Social Benefits</h2>
<p>Most states still implement the Clinton welfare reform that banned drug convicts from getting Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits. Other than being unfair, the policy adversely affects drug users striving to rebuild themselves. The situation gets worse for single parents, young unemployed couples, and those with disabilities. Undoubtedly, the policy increases their problems increasing the chances of falling back to addiction.</p>
<p>Disallowing social benefits is the worst possible solution to drug addiction, assuming we are trying to find the safest way for people to live in a cultured society. Addicts are strong, resourceful, and can likely find a place to sleep in which you and I would not find to be acceptable. However, they still must eat. Proven throughout history is that someone who is hungry will find a way to feed themselves, taking away formal means of finding income does not justify allowing prosecution for someone who finds a way to sustain themselves outside of legislative barriers.</p>

<p>The conclusion is that drug addicts are treated unfairly for aspects of their life outside of their control.

At Pathways, we want to make sure you have the best tools at your disposal to achieve your goals. We will show you how transitioning from negativity to a more positive outlook can improve every aspect of your life.</p>
<h2>What is Self-Talk?</h2>
<p><span id="more-3134"></span></p>
<p>Self-talk isn&#8217;t limited to just your thoughts – it also includes your beliefs and feelings about yourself and the world around you. Self-talk can be either conscious or subconscious, and it affects everything that you do. Negative self-talk leads to a negative attitude that causes you to sabotage yourself. Positive self-talk, on the other hand, helps you to feel better about yourself and puts you in the right frame of mind to achieve success. Learning to correct negative thinking patterns is all about seizing control of your inner dialogue and breaking thought patterns that you have been building and developing your entire life.</p>
<h2>How Does Negative Thinking Affect You?</h2>
<p>According to an <strong>article in Psychology Today</strong>, negative thoughts have a big impact on brain function. Not only does negative thinking make it harder for you to think logically, but the fear of failure that is often associated with negativity slows down activity in the cerebellum. This results in a reduced ability to come up with creative solutions to the problems you face.</p>
<p>That fear of failure that negative thinkers often have also affects the left temporal lobe of the brain. Not only do your fears drag your mood down, but you may suffer from a bad memory or poor impulse control.</p>
<p>When you make a habit of negative thinking, you are essentially re-wiring your brain. As you focus on all those fears and worries, the brain actually begins to change, strengthening the synapses and neurons that are most closely associated with negative thought.</p>
<p>The changes in your brain are what makes it so difficult to overcome a negative attitude. You aren&#8217;t simply working to correct negative thoughts – you are working against thoughts and beliefs that have become so deeply ingrained that they are a part of the structure of your brain.</p>
<h2>Re-Training Your Brain with Positive Thoughts</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the changes made to your brain by negative thought processes are reversible – you can use the power of optimism to undo the damage caused by years of fear, worry and anxiety. Scientists have found that positive people have much more activity in the pre-frontal cortex of the brain.</p>
<p>When you think of positive thought like a workout for your brain, it&#8217;s easy to see how simply thinking good things and striving to have a positive attitude can reshape your outlook on life. As you begin to use optimism and positive affirmations, you will be firing up neurons and synapses that haven&#8217;t seen a lot of use. Just like physical exercise, as you strengthen your neural pathways, it will become easier and easier to have a positive attitude.</p>
<h2>Using Positive Affirmations to Improve the Quality of Your Life</h2>
<p>Positive affirmations are the tool you will use to improve your negative thinking patterns. These affirmations come in the form of short, optimistic statements. A good positive affirmation will target the particular beliefs that are the foundation of your negative thought processes. As you repeat your positive affirmations, your subconscious mind will take hold of these new positive thoughts and your negative thoughts will begin to disappear.</p>
<p>Affirmations are widely used by counselors because they have an incredibly powerful effect on your entire life. As you work on correcting your negative self-talk, you will gain self-confidence and you&#8217;ll be better equipped to handle the stress in your life. With less negativity, you will find that your relationships with family, friends or your spouse will become less strained, and you may find that you have a greater interest in social activities.</p>
<p>Instead of telling yourself that good events happen because of chance, you will start to believe that good events happened because you worked to make them happen. Since you worked hard to make great things happen, you&#8217;ll be more willing to keep working towards positive goals. People who change their thought processes from negative to positive often find new doors opening in their lives. Before, a career change or a great new relationship may have seemed impossible, but with a positive outlook, you will have the tools to make those things happen.</p>
<p>The best part about positive affirmations is that you should start to see the benefits immediately. Some people have to work harder than others to completely eliminate negative thought patterns. However, even on the first day, you should see some improvements to your confidence while the fears and worries that you&#8217;ve held for so long will start to fade.</p>
<h2>Your New Optimistic Outlook Brings Health Benefits Too</h2>
<p>Positive self-talk isn&#8217;t just about improving how you feel about yourself. As you use positive affirmations to improve your thinking patterns, you&#8217;ll also find that it comes with several health benefits. Happy, positive people make healthy lifestyle choices. You&#8217;ll be more likely to exercise and eat right. Studies have also shown that optimists have better immune systems.</p>
<p>According to <strong>research from the University of Pittsburgh</strong>, positive people live longer too. Over eight years, the study found that women over the age of 50 who were optimists were 14-percent less likely to die than pessimistic women. When the researchers looked at women who died from heart disease, the positive thinkers were 30-percent less likely to die.</p>

		<title>If Treatment Takes Credit When Recovery Is Successful, Shouldn’t They Also Take Blame When It’s Not?</title>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='If Treatment Takes Credit When Recovery Is Successful, Shouldn’t They Also Take Blame When It’s Not?' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/taking-responsibility-for-success-or-failure/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p class="ffb-id-pk3copb fg-paragraph text-left    fg-text-dark">Get clean and stay clean! This is the message that people receive when going through treatment at most rehabilitation facilities. While this is a good message and it is the <a href="/why-pathways/">basis of rehabilitation</a>, it’s important not to stop the treatment there. There are so many issues at the root of addiction that you cannot simply treat the addiction and walk away.</p>
<p><span id="more-2035"></span></p>
<h2>How to Approach Rehabilitation</h2>
<h3>Accountability</h3>
<p>It’s completely normal to hear a rehabilitation facility take credit for helping someone break free of an addiction. It is, however, practically unheard of for a rehabilitation facility to take the blame when it doesn’t go so well. This is a problem that must be addressed. If you can take credit for the successes but not take blame for the failures, then what level accountability are you being held to?</p>
<h3>Find the Root of the Problem</h3>
<p>Treatment should not be all about the addiction. True treatment addresses every portion of a clients’ life and helps them heal and recover all parts of their life. Treating should involve getting to the root of the problem and helping to get a person in the right shape physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially. By doing this, the addiction is being treated as well as the root causes of the addiction.</p>

<h3>Don&#8217;t Stop Until the Problem&#8217;s Treated</h3>
<p>If you were to go to a doctor for a runny nose and he simply wiped your nose with a tissue and sent you along on your way, this would not be considered a successful doctor’s visit. The same applies to rehabilitation and treatment; you simply cannot treat the symptom and leave the disease. When this happens, you’re essentially dooming that person to a relapse.</p>
<p>Addiction can be overcome but it starts with the right approach. <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/">Treating an addiction</a> is not as simple as saying “Don’t do drugs anymore.” It has to start with a Whole Life Approach, helping to get their entire life running the right way. The addiction is only a small portion of a bigger issue and must be addressed as such.</p><style></style><script type="text/javascript"></script>
