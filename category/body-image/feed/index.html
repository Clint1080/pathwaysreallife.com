We all worry about our height, weight, scars, or the size of our bodies in various ways. However, you should know that it&#8217;s possible to celebrate being healthy, and you can be happy and goofy on the beach while loving who you are. Though it might be tough to feel great in the summer, especially at the beginning, we want to offer some tips to help you celebrate your fabulous body. <em><strong>Here are some tips you can follow to stay positive about your body all summer long.</strong></em></p>
<p><span id="more-4434"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Fall in Love with Your Body</strong></h2>
<p>There is beauty in bodies of all shapes and sizes, and you should learn to love the way you fit into your bathing suit and celebrate the diversity of bodies in the world. There are many different body types out there, not one is the same, and this something to be celebrated. Our world is made of varieties of bodies, not just one type. Your best features are what make you different. Celebrate and honor the incredibly efficient and miraculous machine that is your body. Make a list of all the amazing things it allows you to do like dancing, talking, and even making another human being. Another tip to help you feel good about yourself is to make a list of things you like about yourself that are <strong><em>unrelated to how you look</em></strong>. Are you a good singer? Did you start your own successful business? Are you compassionate to strangers? Can you cook like no one’s business? Take every chance you get to read your list and celebrate you and your body.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Practice Body Positive Affirmations</strong></h2>
<p>Practicing body positive affirmations is a great way to let go of our subconscious negative self-talk, and begin to learn how to embrace the beauty inside.<a href="https://pathwaysrealliferecovery.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/positive-affirmations-to-change-your-life-ebook.pdf"> Positive affirmations</a> are a part of <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/">cognitive behavioral therapy</a>, which helps you replace your negative feelings and thoughts with positive ones.</p>
<p>Some examples of body positive affirmations you can practice may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>I love and respect my body as it is today.</li>
<li>Food is not the enemy, and I thank the food I eat for nourishing my body.</li>
<li>A goal weight is an arbitrary number, how I feel is what’s important.</li>
<li>Life doesn’t start 10 pounds from now, it’s already started. I can make the choice to include myself in it.</li>
<li>Other people are too busy thinking about themselves to care what my weight is.</li>
<li>ALL images in magazines are airbrushed, photoshopped, and distorted.</li>
<li>Being skinny or fat is not my identity. I am identified by who I am on the inside, a loving, wonderful person.</li>
<li>I thank you, body, for serving me in ______ way today. You always take such good care of me.</li>
<li>My worth isn&#8217;t defined by my weight. I define my worth and I am worthy.</li>
<li>Society has taught me to hate my ______. Today, I declare that I love my _____ because of its ______.</li>
</ul>
<p>These subtle body affirmations seep into your subconscious mind and retrain your brain to think positively about your body, and of the most fun in the summer months.</p>

<h2><strong>Look at Media that Makes You Feel Good</strong></h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re constantly comparing yourself to people you see online, STOP! This can be one of the most destructive things we do to ourselves. Social media is meant to entertain, inform, and connect you with old friends and distant family members. Don’t use social media to make you feel bad about yourself. Follow people who celebrate the diversity of the human form, and unfollow those who make you make you feel negative. You want to surround yourself with media influences that are inclusive of all types of body types and people.</p>
<h2><strong>Indulge in Summer</strong></h2>
<p>Make sure that you indulge in summer&#8217;s treats, but remember everything in moderation. Think about what you’re eating and how it makes your body feel. Eat food that makes you feel good about your body. Eating healthy doesn’t have to be bad. Try out a new cookbook or experiment in the kitchen with a balanced diet that will keep you healthy. Then, you can feel good about what you&#8217;re eating. Eat healthy, most of the time and you won’t have to feel guilty about indulging occasionally.</p>
<h2><strong>Get Your Friends on Your Team</strong></h2>
<p>Find supportive friends who love you for who you are, and don&#8217;t worry about the toxic folks out there. If you are spending time with people whom you think are not supportive, then you may need to cut them out of your life. You don&#8217;t need the negativity to bring you down. Having friends who support you and encourage you to be yourself can make a world of difference.</p>
<h2><strong>Wear What You Feel Good In</strong></h2>
<p>Love your body, and love your wardrobe. Wear clothes that fit you and make you feel good about yourself. Also, you may want to consider getting rid of old clothes that don’t fit and have been taking up space. Having an old pair of jeans that used to fit can be discouraging, so let them go and get something that makes you feel fabulous. And Keep in mind, you don&#8217;t have to wear a bikini, short shorts, or tank tops to dress summery. If clothing like that makes you uncomfortable, you don’t have to wear them. You can wear a colorful maxi dress, bright lipstick, big glasses, and floppy hats are a great way to play with summer trends without making you feel uncomfortable.</p>

<h2><strong>Get Moving</strong></h2>
<p>Be sure that you get moving, because exercise is one of the best ways to stay healthy. It boosts your endorphins and gives you some extra serotonin. You&#8217;ll feel good about yourself, and your body will repair itself more quickly. Exercise doesn’t have to be about weight loss, and it doesn’t have to happen at a gym. Join a recreational sports team, go for a bike ride, or take your doggy for a walk. Try to focus on fitness goals like running a marathon or lowering your cholesterol versus weight loss. This will improve your overall health and outlook about it.</p>
<p>So, now that you know what to do, get out there and be joyful in your fabulous body, and don&#8217;t forget to spread the love around to others, too!</p>

Seemingly unaware of the whole incident, when it was explained to Clarkson, she laughed it off and maintained that the critical woman could only say such mean-spirited things because she did not know Clarkson. &#8220;I&#8217;m awesome! It doesn&#8217;t bother me.”</p>
<p><span id="more-3424"></span></p>
<p>Clarkson also went on to say that since having a family, she no longer seeks external acceptance: “It&#8217;s more if I&#8217;m happy and I&#8217;m confident and feeling good.” One play of this jubilant duet collaboration between Clarkson and Jimmy Fallon is dancing proof that Clarkson means every single word! This is a woman clearly comfortable in her skin, regardless of how much of it she may currently inhabit. She is celebrating her talent, expressing her joy, and sharing vibrant, creative connections with others.</p>
<p>Kelly Clarkson appears to have a very healthy body image. She is realistic about her self-perception, comfortable in her body, and knows that she is so much more than just her appearance in any given moment. For some people, <a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/every-body-different" target="_blank" title="Loving the Skin You're in - Every Body is Different" rel="noopener noreferrer">body image</a> is a constant source of preoccupation, obsession, and self-flagellation. Painful distortions and negative self-perceptions can permeate and undermine every part of the life of someone who holds a poor body image. We have some ideas to help you turn this mindset around if you relate.</p>
<h2><strong>Positive Body Image Tips</strong></h2>
<p>As Walt Whitman asserts, you are far more than the sum of your body parts! Here are a few suggestions to help you remember that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Practice</strong> loving kindness, or at the very least, neutral acceptance, for the specific areas of your body that you wish looked differently.</li>
<li><strong>Celebrate</strong> and honor the incredibly efficient and miraculous machine that is your body. Make a list of all the amazing things it allows you to do: the freedom you have to move through space, communicate with others, feel the breeze, smell the jasmine. Try to discover a new item or two every day to add to your list; something you can do simply because you have a fabulous body, for which you are grateful!</li>
<li><strong>Create</strong> a top ten list of things that you like most about yourself totally unrelated to your physical appearance. Are you smart? Witty? Compassionate? Uber-creative in the kitchen? Can you sing gospel, calm a frightened dog, or comfort a child? Every time you feel a bit low, read your list. Quote Kelly Clarkson to yourself: “I know me! I’m awesome!”</li>
<li><strong>Treat</strong> yourself as well as you treat your loved ones and strangers. You would always consider their feelings and pride before intentionally saying anything to wound them, so grant yourself the same consideration in the way you speak, and think, to yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Balance</strong> your perspective about how much you weigh with the overall state of your health. Are you fit enough to be as physically active as you like? Are your blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels normal? Fit has many shapes and sizes.</li>
<li><strong>Compromise</strong> with yourself. Dump the all-or-nothing attitude when it comes to what you eat and what you weigh. So many times what people allow themselves to do, or be, or have, is all tied up with a number on the scale. Everything is not black or white; life holds a lot of gray. Accept the gray. Acknowledge your progress. Don’t demand perfection.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3425 style= aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Be-you-tiful.png" alt="Be-you-tiful" width="400" height="250" srcset="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Be-you-tiful.png 400w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Be-you-tiful-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Positive Body Image Activities</strong></h2>
<p>Are there areas of your life that are too small for you that might cause you to lose perspective and constrict your focus onto your weight and body size? Here are some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surround</strong> yourself with positive people who remind you of your inner strength and beauty. Hang out only with people with whom you feel safe, seen, cherished, and accepted for exactly who you are, inside and out. If boundary setting is a challenge for you, get support. Your time and energy are precious. Share them with people deserving of them.</li>
<li><strong>Employ</strong> positive affirmations that really speak to you. Use them to replace the negative self-talk, which is really just a bad habit that you can turn around into a self-supporting one.</li>
<li><strong>Dress</strong> up your self-esteem in your unique personal style! Wear comfortable clothes that feel good on your body, in colors that make you happy.</li>
<li><strong>Express</strong> yourself creatively and physically. Mood definitely affects body image, and moods can be shifted by action. Do you think Kelly Clarkson was obsessing about her weight when performing with Jimmy Fallon? Dance, sing, paint, or collage. Perform yoga, Pilates, or take a long, hard walk with your favorite music pounding in your ears.</li>
<li><strong>Allow</strong> yourself some slack. Depriving yourself of something you really want in the moment in which you desire it can often boomerang later. Resisting a piece of birthday cake now might prompt a binge later, just for compensation’s sake. Don’t create “never allowed” foods. Give yourself the gift of “OK sometimes if I really, really want it” treats.</li>
</ul>
