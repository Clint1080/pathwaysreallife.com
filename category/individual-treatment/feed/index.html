You are taking the first step towards reclaiming your life purpose as you embark on the next chapter in your personal journey.</p>
<p>That said, managing the delicate balancing act of sticking with rehab while remaining committed to the job search can seem overwhelming in the best of times. This guide provides insightful tips on how to strike that perfect balance you need to land a job while staying clean and committed to rehabilitation.</p>
<p><span id="more-4362"></span></p>
<h2>General Advice for Reentering the Workforce Post-Rehab</h2>
<p>One of the best things you can do during a job search is to focus on the things you can control. Avoid getting stressed out about the job search since these stresses will likely tempt you to go back down the dark path you worked so hard to overcome.</p>
<p>To keep stress down, compartmentalize your life into manageable areas while surrounding yourself with a network of support. Whether that is family, sober friends or a mentor at rehab, stay close to the people who will keep you on the right footing.</p>
<p>Rely on your support group, but do not rely on them exclusively: There are also factors solely within your control.</p>
<p>First, stay positive. It can be easy to fall into the trap of negative thinking that no employer hires individuals with a past history of substance abuse. Not only is this untrue, but this line of thinking makes it easy to sell yourself short.</p>
<p>You have so much to offer the world, so persevere, stay positive and you will be amazed at how far your hard work and resilience will take you.</p>
<h2>Sticking With Your Rehab Program During the Job Search</h2>
<p>One of the best things you can do during a job search is to focus on the things you can control. Avoid getting stressed out about the job search since these stresses will likely tempt you to go back down the dark path you worked so hard to overcome.</p>
<p>To keep stress down, compartmentalize your life into manageable areas while surrounding yourself with a network of support. Whether that is family, sober friends or a mentor at rehab, stay close to the people who will keep you on the right footing.</p>
<p>Managing this delicate balance helps you stay committed to your rehab program. Rehab programs provide you with a safety net of job reentry resources and the support network needed to make the transition from your old lifestyle to a new one that is filled with possibility.</p>
<h2>Job Search Tips and Suggestions</h2>
<p>For generalized job search tips and advice, here are a few key things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search for jobs that reflect your passion and excitement</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t know what excites you, take a career assessment test to get a better idea</li>
<li>When searching for jobs, consider the company culture and the fit</li>
<li>Rely on job networks, family, and friends to find compelling opportunities</li>
<li>Search for promising internships and/or volunteer work</li>
<li>For anyone with a criminal record, <a href="http://www.hirenetwork.org/">search the HIRE Network</a></li>
<li>If you want to take charge of your career and life, consider taking on the challenge of starting your own business</li>
</ul>
<p>These suggestions are just a few of the many paths you can take when charting your own course after succeeding in rehab. Your life story is your own, so use these tips to pave your path towards a promising career.</p>
<h2>If You Need Assistance, We&#8217;re Here to Help</h2>
<p>Finally, always know that help is available when you need it. Nobody can get through life without help, resources and support in times of need.</p>
<p>You do not have to go through the job search alone, and <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/">Pathway Real Life Recovery</a> is here to help when you need us. We can help you find vocational work, assist you with job placement and help you pay your way through college.</p>

<p>If you are in recovery, negative thoughts may try to plague your life. These types of thoughts can make you feel as if your life isn’t going anywhere, and can ultimately hurt your recovery process. This is why being thankful is important. Being thankful is about focusing on the good things in your life; the things that make you happy and make your life feel full. A positive attitude has been shown to help those in recovery not only recover faster, but also reduce the chances of relapse. Why? Those who are thankful and positive often:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 15px;">
<div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">
<ul>
<li><i class="sui sui-chevron-circle-right" style="color:#4d7599"></i> Have friends that pull equal weight in the relationship</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-chevron-circle-right" style="color:#4d7599"></i> Have better outlook on the future,</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-chevron-circle-right" style="color:#4d7599"></i> Tend to be in less interpersonal conflict</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-chevron-circle-right" style="color:#4d7599"></i> Have Less Stress</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-chevron-circle-right" style="color:#4d7599"></i> Are less self-absorbed</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p><span id="more-4278"></span></p>
<p>The problem may not be being thankful, but it might be finding out what to be thankful and grateful for. If you’re struggling to find something to be grateful for while in the process of recovery here are just a few things that you can find to be thankful for.</p>
<h2><strong>Spend Quality Time with Loved Ones</strong></h2>
<p>Your loved ones are some of the most important people in your life. They love you, they support you, and they want you to get through recovery and be successful.  If you are an addict, having family members with you on your journey can help give you solid ground to fall on, a glimmer of hope to hold on to, and the reminder to never give up and fall back. And, with family, even if you take a few steps backwards, they will always be there to help push you forward.</p>
<h2><strong>Ability to Work</strong></h2>
<p>Working and making money makes anyone feel like a superstar. Holding down a job makes you a productive and contributing member of society. By keeping your mind and your hands busy, not only do you take your thoughts away from substance use, but it also gives you a reason to get up in the morning and something to remind you why you are fighting to get clean. A job can represent life after recovery and to many addicts that can be the light at the end of the tunnel that helps keep them on the road to recovery.</p>
<h2><strong>Your Health and Well Being</strong></h2>
<p>Alcohol and illegal substances when abused can absolutely wreck your body and cause a multitude of health issues. Substance abuse can turn anyone into a shell of who they once were, not only showing physical signs but emotional and mental signs as well. By going into recovery, you are reclaiming your physical, mental, and emotional health and saying you want to be in control. Poor health equals poor life quality, and if you are thankful for the chance to regain all aspects of good health you are that much more likely to be successful in your recovery program.</p>
<h2><strong>Helping Others</strong></h2>
<p>When on substances of any kind it changes you as a person. You may can become impatient, mean, or even completely self-absorbed. This means that you will miss out on some of the simple things in life, such as helping prepare a family dinner, doing homework with your kids, or participating in volunteer activities. These activities can help fill up those empty spots in your life that would otherwise have been filled with getting high or drunk; instead you can relish in the fact that you are helping someone else complete a task they may not have been able to do without you. And, once you are completely recovered, reminding yourself about your ability to help and contribute to society can help keep you on the straight and narrow.</p>
<h2><strong>Having Fun</strong></h2>
<p>Addiction takes up all your free time, it sucks away at your life, and becomes an all-consuming activity. It turns star athletes into couch potatoes, fun loving young adults into zombies, and can take almost anyone away from the things they love. When you aren’t sober, you don’t have a chance to enjoy the activities in life that you once found fun. During recovery try and find time to do these things again. Pick up your favorite book, get back to scrapbooking, or take up a sport you haven’t played in a long time. These activities will help fill that void that substances took up for the longest time, it can get you out of your own head, and can help give you a more positive outlook. Be thankful for fun and the fact that in recovery you can enjoy things once again, instead of locking yourself away in the dark looking for your next high.</p>
<div class="videoWrapper" style="text-align: center;"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EfhgGe4-RGc?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>
<h2><strong>Attitude of Gratitude: The Pathways Difference</strong></h2>
<p>One of the most important things you can do during your time in recovery is to never give up and to continuously look on the bright side. By taking in all the wonderful things in your life you can reject the negative and put yourself on a bright, and beautiful path for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com">Pathways</a> we know how hard it can be to be thankful for the things in your life, and to stay positive during the dark times that recovery may sometimes bring. This is why at Pathways we find a REAL solution to help you recover quickly and easily. We work with your family too! Recovery doesn’t just hurt you and your body, it can also be taxing for your immediate family, and we understand that. We work with the entire family unit to make it healthy and help it function properly again. We use techniques that will help you in the real world to not only overcome your addiction, but keep it from invading your life again.</p>
<p>Pathways knows that the road to recovery is seldom an easy one, but we also know that the benefits of getting clean and sober greatly outweigh staying dependent on substances. Getting clean can make you a better person with a great life. <a href="/programs/">Recovery is waiting</a> for you so never give up.</p>
