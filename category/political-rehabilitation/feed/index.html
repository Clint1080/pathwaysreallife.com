It causes changes in the neural pathways that remember the <em>pleasures</em> of activities such as eating, sex, alcohol and drug use, gambling, etc. When triggered, these pleasurable memories cause an overwhelming desire to repeat the experience. Without the proper skills to overcome this desire, and without dealing with the root causes of the issues that led to the addictions to begin with, it’s easy to fall into the cycle of addiction. After all, pleasure is a hard thing to resist.<br />
<span id="more-3674"></span></p>
<p>With this in mind, let’s look at 5 things about addiction that may surprise you.</p>
<h2>D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) Causes More Harm than Good</h2>
<p>Founded by a former police officer with the help of Los Angeles schools, the goal of the D.A.R.E. program is to decrease drug use in schools. Although the program sounds ideal and has great intentions, D.A.R.E. has failed to reach its objectives. Peer reviews and studies have shown that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-just-say-no-doesnt-work/?page=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D.A.R.E. program may actually increase the likelihood for teens to drink and smoke</a>.</li>
<li>The program possibly <a href="https://www.alcoholfacts.org/DARE.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increased drug use among teenage girls</a>.</li>
<li>It was determined “that D.A.R.E. simply didn’t work” in a study done for the U.S. Bureau of Justice Assistance.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Trading Addictions</h2>
<p>If a person beats their addiction to drugs or alcohol, but have not dealt with the underlying issues that led to their addictive behavior in the first place, they often find themselves addicted to another drug or substance. This is called cross addiction. It also explains why people often develop a new addiction, such as that to sugary or fatty foods, after completing treatment. Unfortunately, this new addiction often leads the person back to their original drug of choice, starting the cycle all over again.</p>
<h2>You Can Be Addicted to Practically Anything</h2>
<p>According to <strong>Psychology Today</strong>, addiction is a condition that occurs when a person ingests a substance or engages in a pleasurable activity to the point that it becomes compulsive and interferes with ordinary life responsibilities.</p>
<h2>You really can be addicted to almost anything. Examples of addictive substances include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol</li>
<li>Drugs: cocaine, heroine, meth-amphetamines, opiates, etc.</li>
<li>Nicotine</li>
<li>Caffeine</li>
<li>Many different prescription medications</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of addictive behaviors or activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gambling</li>
<li>Sex</li>
<li>Shopping</li>
<li>Pornography</li>
<li>Overeating</li>
<li>Video games</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people think that overcoming an addiction to something like gambling can’t be as difficult as overcoming an addiction to nicotine or heroine. However, research shows that gambling addicts may suffer physical withdrawal symptoms that rival those of drug withdrawals. The symptoms include difficulty breathing, heart palpitations, and pain throughout the body, proving that addiction is more about a set of behaviors than the properties of the addictive substances.</p>
<p>Caffeine is another of those “innocent” addictions. In fact, it is often joked about and viewed as not much of a problem. It is so addicting that people often experience problems giving it up even when advised to do so by their health care providers.</p>
<h2>Alcoholics Anonymous</h2>
<p>Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the original 12-step program designed to overcome alcohol addiction. It was adapted to deal with narcotic addictions as well. It is often the first step someone takes when they decide to deal with their substance abuse and addictions. Some people have found success in these 12-step programs, while others have not.</p>
<p>Alcoholics Anonymous has an incredibly strong faith-based component. Acknowledgement of a higher power, often God, and the need to rely on that power to “restore one to sanity” is an integral part of the program. This component can make some people quite uncomfortable. It also encourages people to believe they are incapable of handling the problem on their own, without a higher power.</p>
<p>Contrary to AA’s belief “once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic,” we at Pathways believe that with proper treatment and learning to deal with the root cause of the problem, the need to take part in addictive behaviors goes away.</p>
<h2>Treating the Real Cause of Addiction</h2>
<p>Since addictions cause problems that disrupt people’s lives, it’s easy to jump to the conclusion that the addiction is the problem. Following that logic, once the addiction is addressed and the addictive behavior has ceased, then the problem is fixed. The problem with this way of thinking, however, is that the “real” problem has not been dealt with. This means that the addictive behavior is likely to return as the person continues to seek a way to relieve the “real” pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>In his book, <em>Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days in the War on Drugs</em>, Johann Hari shares that addiction actually has very little to do with the drugs themselves. Instead, he argues that the real cause is the lack of proper bonds with other humans. In other words, people are forming a bond to their addiction to fill the void in that area of their lives.</p>

But it’s within our human nature to make a mistake and have a bad judgment. However, we still judge people based on what we expect of our role models. Let’s be honest here, it was pretty amazing that Arnold Schwarzenegger was able to keep his affair with his housekeeper silent for over a decade, and a child came out of that. Same goes for the fact that no one seems to remember that he was videotaped doing drugs while he pumped iron, yet he was also elected as Governor! To error is human and mistakes are always made, here are some examples of that.</p>
<p><span id="more-2183"></span></p>
<h2>Rob Ford</h2>
<p>Rob Ford is one name that of course comes to mind, especially lately. He has had a name for himself his whole life really. Following in his father’s footsteps, Rob was elected into office in 2000 as a Councilor and in 2010 became Mayor of Toronto.  In 2013, a video surfaced that showed him engaging in not so great acts with drug dealers in Canada. While he denied all allegations, he has since come forth and admitted his actions. While he hasn’t gone to rehab (yet), he’s taken the first step to admitting his problem. Hopefully, soon he will realize what his next step should be, especially to show his children what kind of role model he can be.</p>
<p><center><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2184" alt="Rehab Rob Ford" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rehab-rob-ford.png" width="135" height="219" /></center></p>
<h2>Marion Barry</h2>
<p>The most shocking scandal in politics probably ever will be D.C.’s “Mayor for Life” Marion Barry. He served as Mayor of D.C. from 1975 to 1991 and again 1995 to 1999. Through both terms he was also plagued with numerous controversies through his personal life, he also had numerous professional problems. He received national interest in 1990 due to his troubles and was arrested by the FBI and served time in Federal prison which helped him be reelected in 1994. Since 2002 Marion has been continuously in the news with all kinds of bad news whether it be drug charges or other federal indictments due to tax evasion, racially charges remarks or conflict of interest charges.</p>
<p><center><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2185" alt="Rehab Marion Barry" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rehab-marion-barry.png" width="215" height="161" /></center></p>
<h2>Rush Limbaugh</h2>
<p>Another shocking revelation into the underworld of drugs and politics is Rush Limbaugh. While Rush has always been an avid “illegal drug use is killing this country” speech type of guy, Rush did come out to say in October of 2003 that he did in fact have a drug addiction. While his arrest never came through with a conviction, he did settle his arrest out of court and was put in an 18 month drug treatment program. As of today, he has seemed to beat his demons and so much the better for it. Not all political men and woman can handle the stress and wariness that is comes with politics, Rush seem to handle this well and at the same time, able to complete and maintain his sobriety with some tact and skill. Props Rush![distance1]
<p><center><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2186" alt="Rehab Rush Limbaugh" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rehab-rush-limbaugh.png" width="165" height="192" /></center></p>
<h2>Steve Katz</h2>
<p>There’s always the cases that seem somewhat unreported or under reported due to what some people may consider, insignificant, which in some cases, seems very true. Case in point Steve Katz. He is a veterinarian doctor who is also currently a member of the New York State Assembly. He was arrested and agreed to a plea deal for a small charge due to possession of drugs. He has back tracked on specific issues politically due to these charges. Regardless of your beliefs, being open and honest about your demons is the first step to rehabilitation.[distance1]
<p><center><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rehab-steve-katz.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2187" alt="Rehab Steve Katz" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rehab-steve-katz.png" width="112" height="168" /></a></center></p>
<h2>Mel LeBlanc</h2>
<p>Another political figure that was reported on, but was more of gossipy story, rather than a news worthy article was <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mel LeBlanc</span></b> out of Arlington, TX. In 2012 was caught buying drugs after being under investigation for some time. Being turned in to the police by his wife Candy, the Councilman proceeded to admit to his issues. Mel admitted to his substance abuse problems and had previously entered rehab; he preferred to try to become sober on his own. His wife requested him to enter rehab program in 2011. In 2012, however Mel resigned from office and has somewhat stayed under the radar. Last he was somewhat heard of, was when he wrote a review of Matt Damon’s movie Promised Land, as Mel is a managing partner of a drilling company.</p>
<p><center><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2188" alt="Rehab Mel LeBlanc" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rehab-mel-leblanc.png" width="121" height="179" /></center></p>
<h2>Nadia Lockyer</h2>
<p>One of the most shocking scandals to date however is the scandal that started because of someone trying to better themselves by going to rehab. Bill Lockyer who is the current California State Treasurer and his  wife Nadia Lockyer who in her own right had a name for herself as the once President of the Santa Ana School Board, found she was having a problem drinking so she went to rehab. Meeting someone in rehab, who had substance abuse problem, getting hooked on that with her schedule caused a domino effect that caused her world to shatter. While she is now in treatment, was able to save her marriage and her life is back on track and doing so much better, it took hitting rock bottom before she sought out help. This happens most often than not and its okay, it’s better than never.</p>
<p><center><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2189" alt="Rehab Nadya Lockyer" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rehab-nadya-lockyer.png" width="294" height="225" /></center></p>
<h2>Other Notables</h2>
<p>There have been numerous international politicians who have been a part of an investigation for their involvement in a drug ring, abusing drugs and/or alcohol for example <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Orlando Ranaldi</span></b> of Italy, <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reagan Ufomba</span></b> of Ogoni who was also linked to Nigeria, <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Luke Flanagan</span></b> of the Irish Dail and <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Steve Purcell</span></b> the Scottish councilor who is also known as Tony Blair’s “visionary” who had to be warned about an underworld plot to blackmail him due to so many acts of indiscretions.</p>
<p>All of these politicians have been caught and had to <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/">come to terms with their addictions</a> and have in one form or another, sought out help. Having the strength to stay sober is the next step. These people have great support systems behind them, and so do you.</p>
