Today, that equals to approximately 23.5 million Americans. People who have suffered from an addiction and <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/help-addict-seek-treatment/">sought help through rehabilitation services</a> <strong><em>have only just begun </em></strong>their journey as a clean and sober individual. <strong><em>Once they leave the privacy and intensive care of a rehab facility, they must learn to adjust to everyday life that can be filled with challenges</em></strong>. Here are 5 tips to help your loved one begin their journey sober, post-rehab.</p>
<h2>1. Adjusting Requires Help</h2>
<ul>
<li>Returning to their lives requires the help of those who are closest, such as friends and family. The stronger their support system, the more likely they will maintain their sobriety.</li>
<li>Knowing there are people to lean on <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/inspirational-addiction-recovery-quotes/">when times are tough</a> gives people battling addiction hope. They know they have people to rely on when they need someone to talk to or to assist them with steps in their recovery.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-4868"></span></p>
<h2>2. Focus On Positive Things In Life</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/5-ways-change-negative-beliefs/">Focusing on positive parts of life</a> and healthy habits can help make the process of recovery much easier. Having something else to focus on is really an excellent method to help adjust right after their rehab.</li>
<li>Taking up new hobbies and doing volunteer work are also excellent options for people who need to fill their calendars with worthwhile activities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Remove Any Drugs And Alcohol From Their Everyday Environment</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you are helping someone with their recovery, you must be sensitive to their issue. Avoid keeping alcohol or drugs around you to remove the temptation that may pose directly after a rehab facility stay.</li>
<li>Sticking to this <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/377841/6-ways-help-someone-recover-after-rehab">plan</a> after the first several months post-rehab will make coping much easier for your loved one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Help Them Join And Attend Support Groups</h2>
<ul>
<li>Encourage them to attend support groups, which can really help a person who may feel like they are alone in their battle. Seeing and talking to others openly about issues that affect victims of addiction can give people the feeling of kinship and understanding they need to tackle daily life with their newfound sobriety.</li>
<li>Offer to give them a ride to and from the meeting to give them the extra push they might need to attend.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Encourage Them To See A Recovery Specialists</h2>
<ul>
<li>After a patient is released from rehab, they will likely require some post-rehab care overseen by an experience recovery specialist or recovery <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/sober-recovery-companion-utah/">coach</a>.</li>
<li>Recovery takes time and effort, and a substance abuse counselor can help make their transition to sober life easier.</li>
<li>Help your loved one keep their appointments and encourage them to continue treatment even if they feel better shortly after release.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='5 Ways to Change Negative Beliefs' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/5-ways-change-negative-beliefs/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p><img title="Small steps sign - Pathways Real Life Recovery" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/Change-Negative-Beliefs-About-Yourself.jpg" alt="Beliefs or Believes - Pathways Real Life Recovery" width="100%" /><br />
Sometimes the enemy within can be much more dangerous than outside forces. In fact, struggling with negative beliefs about yourself makes it all too easy to lapse into self-destructive patterns. That’s why breaking that no-win cycle of low self-esteem &#8212; and the bad choices related to it &#8212; is the first step to a more peaceful, productive life. Here are a few methods to help you get there.</p>
<h2><strong>Consider the Source               </strong></h2>
<p>A loving family does not inflict harsh judgment on young children, nor do truly responsible teachers and coaches insult impressionable young people. If you were told you were lazy, unintelligent or homely as a child, remind yourself that those characterizations reflect badly on the adult who said them, rather than on you.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: Write a letter to a person from your past who damaged your self-esteem. You don’t have to actually send the letter but focus on describing that person’s unrealistic standards or constant judgment. The act of writing the letter will help you understand how those unfair words shaped you.</p>
<p><span id="more-4772"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Remember That “Comparisons are Odious”</strong></h2>
<p>It’s a centuries-old saying, but one that still resonates today. Comparing your life or personality to the success of a friend or colleague is one of the surest ways to spiral into self-loathing.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment:</strong> Each day, make a note of something positive about yourself. Whether it’s a kindness you did for a co-worker, a new skill you’ve mastered, or even something “vain” like a flattering new hairstyle, it’s important to make note of these good things. Periodically reading this self-positivity journal will help you understand your own self-worth.</p>
<h2><strong>Name Your Unhealthy Beliefs</strong></h2>
<p>It’s one thing to know in general that a bad self-image will bring you down &#8212; and another to identify some specific faults. Once you identify those supposed flaws, you can start to learn how to break that cycle of self-doubt.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: <a title="Changing Core Beliefs, Emotional Reactions and Behaviors - Pathways Real Life Recovery" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/changing-core-beliefs-emotional-reactions-behaviors/">Belief-restructuring therapy </a>can be an essential tool on your road to well-being. Customized treatment sessions help you identify, then address, these core beliefs about yourself that are weighing you down emotionally.</p>
<h2><strong>Interrogate Your Fears</strong></h2>
<p>It seems logical that if we have something we dislike about ourselves, then we’d do anything to change it, right? Yet lurking within many of us is the suspicion that what we don’t like is so intrinsic to our personalities that it can’t be changed &#8212; or that even if we solve or disprove that one trait, even worse ones will be lurking. Therefore, it’s easier to complain about what we don’t like about ourselves, rather than to do something which might fail.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: It may seem silly, but the question “What’s the worst that could happen?” is an essential one to ask. Often, naming your fear makes you realize that it’s either unlikely or easily solved. And if you find that this simple, self-directed exercise isn’t doing the trick, there are other options. <a title="Anxiety Treatment in Utah - Changing Negative Beliefs - Pathways Real Life Recovery" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/anxiety-treatment-utah/">Professional sessions specially designed to treat anxiety</a> are excellent tools in your quest to banish those negative beliefs and their surrounding fears.</p>
<h2><strong>Envision a Brighter Future</strong></h2>
<p>Once you do begin to overcome your fear of failure and explode some of those self-doubting myths, it’s time to expand your horizons. If you’ve always told yourself you weren’t creative, for example, what can you now accomplish, after accepting that you might have an artistic bent after all?</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: Now comes the fun part. Brainstorm ways to catch up on what you’ve been missing all those years when you decreed yourself not good enough for a certain pursuit, be it hobby, career or even romance! Make a list of all you’ve been missing and concrete steps you can take to achieve the goals you once believed you weren’t good enough for.</p>
