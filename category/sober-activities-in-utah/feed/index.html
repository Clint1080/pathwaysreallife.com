<p>Many people drink on Halloween, but there are plenty of other ways to celebrate this holiday. There are plenty of eventful activities taking place here in Utah that you can enjoy, without having to feel the need for intoxication to have a good time. All of them really capture the spirit of Halloween, and you don&#8217;t have to wait until 21 to do them, or give them up at any age.</p>
<p><span id="more-4496"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong> Enjoying a Lovely Fall Festival</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <a href="https://www.awhc.org/index.php/fall-festival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American West Heritage Center&#8217;s Fall Festival</a> is the sort of family fun destination that people are really going to remember. This festival is open from 27th September to 31st of October; October 18th and 19th are some of the best days of the festival. At the American West Heritage Center&#8217;s Fall Festival, people can enjoy pony rides, a hay jump, a Haunted Hollow, corn maze, gourd launch, and the giant slide.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong> Great Adventures with Haunted Houses</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Nothing says Halloween like haunted houses, especially <a href="http://www.lagoonpark.com/what-to-do/frightmares/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frightmares held at Lagoon theme park</a>. There are seven different haunted attractions there, so you will be sure to find something that you like. This attraction opened on September 16th, 2016 and it will be open until the 30th of October.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong> Halloween on the Water</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You might not associate Halloween with a cruise, but a <a href="http://clasropes.com/christmas---cruise.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halloween Cruise on the Provo River</a> really can make all the difference in terms of creating a seasonal mood. You can see all of the beautiful autumn leaves from the boat, and you can see the gorgeous riparian landscapes as the boat drifts along the water.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong> A Night of Spooky Classical Music</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For only twelve dollars a ticket, you can enjoy a lovely evening of classical music just in time for the Halloween season, at the <a href="http://www.utahsymphony.org/component/k2/1235-halloween-spooktacular-on-the-seven-seas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Utah Symphony&#8217;s Halloween Spooktacular on the Seven Seas</a>. The show starts on 25th October at 7 pm at night, and it lasts for around two hours with an intermission period.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong> Race to Halloween</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you like to run 5Ks and would like to enjoy Halloween in a more active way, you can enjoy running in a Halloween-themed race this year! You can register today for the <a href="http://www.thehauntedhustle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haunted Hustle</a>. Running from the monsters is a time-honored tradition in horror movies, and you can demonstrate how good you would be in that sort of event, by registering for the Haunted Hustle or the <strong>5KRunDead</strong>. The 5KRunDead is a zombie run, so you&#8217;re really going to be able to get into the spirit of Halloween that way. All of the proceeds will be donated to Alzheimer&#8217;s research, so you&#8217;re doing something great for people&#8217;s brains while on a zombie run.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h3><strong> Visiting a Real Haunted Forest</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are lots of attractions for the people who are interested in Halloween events. However, this is the one that takes place in an actual <a href="http://www.hauntedutah.com/haunted_forest_index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forest</a> with real trails. It isn&#8217;t just some indoor museum-type tourist trap where everything is clearly fake. This is an attraction that will really make you feel haunted.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h3><strong> A Convention of Fear</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to go to <a href="http://www.coupons4utah.com/coupon-mall/fear-con-utah-coupon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fear Con</a>, you&#8217;ll really have the opportunity to have some futuristic Halloween fun with virtual reality games and a realistic zombie survival course, among other things. This event takes place on the 28th or 29<sup>th</sup> of October, which should give you plenty of time to plan for this day of street performers and various haunted attractions.</p>
<h3>Free (or nearly free) things to do:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Pumpkin carving, save the seeds and roast them afterwards</li>
<li>Have a movie night</li>
<li>Volunteer in your community</li>
<li>Have a bonfire and roast marshmallows</li>
<li>Go on a hike or a fall foliage drive up the canyon</li>
<li>Knit a scarf</li>
</ol>

Many people feel the temptation to drink during this time. If you would rather avoid drinking and maintain your sobriety, you will find lots of ways to celebrate without the need for alcohol. Cast aside the green beer just as St. Patrick cast out the snakes from Ireland. Embrace the delight that is Irish culture without the booze.</p>
<p><span id="more-4355"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Take an Irish Dancing Class</strong></h2>
<p>Enjoy beautiful music and <em><strong>learn how to dance all kinds of age old Irish dances right here in Utah</strong></em>. Irish step dancing can help you get into great shape.</p>
<h2><strong>Watch an Irish Movie <img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4358" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/ee9f871670ec56f95085db0b1fc50d27-300x300.jpg" alt="kiss-me-im-sober" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/ee9f871670ec56f95085db0b1fc50d27-300x300.jpg 300w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/ee9f871670ec56f95085db0b1fc50d27-150x150.jpg 150w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/ee9f871670ec56f95085db0b1fc50d27-180x180.jpg 180w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/ee9f871670ec56f95085db0b1fc50d27.jpg 564w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></h2>
<p>Many fine movies have been set in Irish. To celebrate, the proud Irish of the Hibernian Society of Utah are hosting an Irish film series just in time for St. Patrick&#8217;s Day. Join them and watch Academy-Award wining movies such as Michael Collins, Ryan&#8217;s Daughter and A Terrible Beauty. If staying home is more your style, relax with friends and family and hold an Irish movie marathon of your own. Pick out classic movies like &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_Kells">The Secret of Kells</a>&#8221; to help bring your Irish heritage to life.</p>
<h2><strong><br />
Throw Your Own Party</strong></h2>
<p>Invite friends over to your house and hold a St. Patrick&#8217;s Day party. Stick with people who care about helping you stay sober. Put on some Irish themed music and play party games like an Irish themed game of Pictionary.  Expand your knowledge of Irish culture, history and language with your friends in a low key setting for alcohol-free fun.</p>
<h2><strong>Go To Utah’s St. Patrick&#8217;s Day Parade</strong></h2>
<p>Take some time off from your ordinary routine. Watch the parade in person on March 12 at 10 a.m. The march begins on 400 West and at 200 North then runs south through the Gateway to 200 South and passes  through the Gateway Center. Bask in the warming weather as the parade passes by. Parade organizers ask that all people submit an entry form if they want to participate in the parade.  Find information about participating and walking in the parade at the &#8220;Parade Entry&#8221; link at right. If coming from other parts of Utah, take TRAX to the parade and Siamsa. This way, you can save money and parking hassles.</p>
<h2><strong>Make Your Own Irish Feast</strong></h2>

<p>Irish cooking is a lively combination of ingredients like potatoes, fish, cabbage and smoked beef that everyone loves. Buy a large corned beef and a thick head of cabbage to boil together to make at home. Throw in a loaf of store-bought or homemade Irish soda bread topped with delicious, widely available Irish butter for your own perfect traditional Irish lunch. Or update the classic sandwich with these delicious <a href="http://www.celebrations.com/c/recipe/slow-cooker-corned-beef-cabbage-sliders">corned beef and cabbage min-sliders</a> cooked carefully and then topped with a tangy mustard. End your meal a round of non-alcoholic shamrock shakes in a shade of bright green and some mint brownies for an Irish themed dessert.</p>
