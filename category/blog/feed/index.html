										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='Benefits of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT)' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/benefits-parent-child-interaction-therapy/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p class="ffb-id-pk3copb fg-paragraph text-left    fg-text-dark">If your young child is experiencing <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/adult-teen-adolescent-behavioral-health-clinic-utah/" title="Behavioral Health Treatment for Adults and Teens in Utah - Parent-Child Interaction Therapy near Salt Lake City Utah">behavioral problems</a>, you have likely tried many methods to attempt to correct these behaviors. Some of these methods may include punishment techniques or positive reinforcement methods. However, if you are not seeing any change in their behavior, you may begin to wonder what you as a parent are doing wrong.</p>
<p><span id="more-4347"></span></p>
<p>Despite your best efforts to remain calm and composed, parents can become tired and irritable when they are subjected to the same behaviors from their child over and over. When this happens, you may not act in such a way that we are making a positive impact on our child as they are disciplined. Unfortunately, your child can then pick up on your bad habits and mirror them, which may be part of the reason that they are acting out, because they see you doing so when you are frustrated. A parent&#8217;s frustration and stress directly relate to our children&#8217;s ability to <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/belief-restructuring/" title="Belief Restructuring Therapy - Parent-Child Interaction Therapist in Utah">process and react to their feelings and behaviors</a>. If you are in this situation, parent-child interaction therapy, or PCIT, may be ideal for you.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4344" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-child-interaction-therapy-pcit-utah.jpg" alt="Parent Child Interaction Therapy" width="600" height="400" title="Experience the benefits of parent child relationship therapy, call Pathways Real Life Recovery today - Parent Child Interaction Therapy in Utah" /><br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<p><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/parent-child-therapy/" title="Parent-child Interaction Therapy near Salt Lake City Utah - What are the benefits of parent child relationship therapy?">Parent-child interaction therapy</a> is a form of therapy for you, the parent. You receive coaching from a child psychology specialist on how to decrease your negative behaviors while improving upon your relationship with your child. This can help to curb behavioral problems in a child. PCIT is a specialized 15-20 session treatment program designed for parents or caregivers and their children aged 10 or younger who may be experiencing behavioral and/or emotional issues. Sessions are an hour long and are done weekly.</p>
<h2>Helps Children Manage Aggressive and Defiant Behaviors</h2>
<p>Parent-child interaction counseling helps target a wide range of <a href="http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/aggression/according-experts/effective-daycare-kindergarten-interventions-prevent-chronic-aggression">aggressive</a> and defiant behaviors in children. Some of those behaviors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swearing</li>
<li>Fighting</li>
<li>Temper tantrums</li>
<li>Refusal to obey rules</li>
<li>Arguing</li>
<li>Low self-esteem</li>
<li>Low frustration threshold</li>
<li>Lying</li>
<li>Blaming others for one&#8217;s actions</li>
</ul>
<p>With such a wide array of behaviors, you may be wondering how this type of counseling can help to solve all of these problems. In order to properly solve behavioral issues, you have to get to the root of the issue with the child. Most of the time, the behavior is one that is learned from the parent and the parent may inadvertently be doing so. For example, when you discipline your child, and they talk back, you may engage with them and argue. If you let them get away with this a couple of times, the habit is formed and it is hard to break without outside assistance. Learning how to break some of these bad habits, and learning techniques to follow yourself when you feel frustrated, will help your child see how to behave in situations. Over time, they will learn by your positive example.</p>
<div class="su-quote su-quote-style-default su-quote-has-cite"><div class="su-quote-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim">Research has shown that, as a result of PCIT, parents learn more effective parenting techniques, the behavior problem of children decrease, and the quality of the parent-child relationship improves.<span class="su-quote-cite">(U.S. Department of Human and Health Services, 2015)</span></div></div>
<h2>Helps Improve Parent-Child Relationships</h2>
<p>One of the biggest benefits to parent-child interaction therapy is that you can improve upon your relationship with your child. Many parents would love a better relationship with their child, but they simply don&#8217;t know how. This type of program teaches you how to communicate with and respect your child, while still asserting your parental position. Creating and establishing a positive relationship is much easier in younger children, so the earlier you start, the better.</p>
<h2>Helps Reduce Child Abuse</h2>
<p>The last benefit to parent-child interaction therapy is that it helps to <a href="http://encompassnw.org/parent-child-interaction-therapy-decreases-tension-and-improves-relationships/">reduce child abuse</a>. When parents are frustrated, they can say things that can be hurtful and emotionally abusive to a child. Unfortunately, they may not even realize because that&#8217;s how they were disciplined as a child. PCIT breaks the cycle of abuse and teaches you how to parent without emotionally or physically abusing your child.</p>

Although schizophrenia affects less than 1% of the population in the US, <b><i>misrepresentation in movies and TV, along with the sheer amount of false information online, have diluted the facts</i></b> about this chronic mental disorder. For those who don&#8217;t know any better, hearing the word &#8216;<i>schizophrenia</i>&#8216; brings to mind an incurable condition with the only treatment being an isolated life sentence in a mental institution. This unfounded stigma could not be farther from the truth.</p>
<p><span id="more-5213"></span><br />
<b><i>Incomplete and distorted details surrounding schizophrenia online complicate a clear awareness</i></b> of the disorder and acceptance for those who suffer from it. As feelings of indifference about mental illness are replaced with compassion and inclusion, schizophrenia remains widely misunderstood. Recognizing that individuals who suffer from this illness <b><i>benefit from a combination of treatment options to live healthy lives</i></b> without being committed is important to finally help begin debunking myths about schizophrenia once and for all.</p>
<p>Knowing the difference between truth and fiction is crucial for family and friends of a loved one struggling with schizophrenia. <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/" title="Pathways Real Life Recovery - Drug Rehab and Addiction Treatment Center in Utah" ><b>Pathways Real Life in Utah</b></a> understands that <b><i>active family support and acceptance from loved ones will play a vital role in the long-term success of each patient&#8217;s individualized treatment plan</i></b>. Supporting your loved one means knowing the facts about their illness and how proper treatment will influence their daily life. Here are the top 3 myths about schizophrenia and the actual truth:</p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Myth #1: Everyone with Schizophrenia Suffers from Hallucinations</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mental illness affects each individual differently and depending on the diagnosis type, the symptoms of schizophrenia can vary widely. While psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and delusions are unnerving and frightening, not every schizophrenia patient has them. This mental illness can include feelings of paranoia or hearing voices, but the following <b><i>lesser-known symptoms can be just as complicated and debilitating</i></b>:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Low Motivation</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Blunted Emotions</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Disorganized Speech</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Difficulty Maintaining Attention</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Lack of Desire to Form Relationships</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Challenge in Performing Cognitive Tasks</b></span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Myth #2: Individuals Diagnosed with Schizophrenia have Multiple Personalities</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Having multiple personalities is not a symptom of schizophrenia.</i></b> This condition is called dissociative identity disorder or DID (formerly referred to as multiple personality disorder). The myth is fueled, partly, from the <b><i>Greek origin of the word schizophrenia which translates to &#8216;split mind&#8217;</i></b>. The explanation of the meaning is simple; &#8216;<i>split mind</i>&#8216; refers to an individual&#8217;s mind that isolates them from other people, essentially &#8216;<i>splitting</i>&#8216; them off from the rest of the world. DID sufferers are sometimes described as having a &#8216;<i>split personality</i>&#8216;.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Myth #3: Individuals with Schizophrenia are Dangerous</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The movie and TV portrayal of individuals with schizophrenia as unpredictable, dangerous and violent. The simple truth is that <b><i>the majority of those diagnosed with schizophrenia are nonviolent</i></b>. Only twenty-three percent of violent crimes committed by patients with schizophrenia were related directly to their illness. Sadly, because of this myth, people with schizophrenia have a diminished quality of life with greater stress and lower self-esteem from fewer employment opportunities and reduced housing options.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Reality of Schizophrenia</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While there is no known cure, <b><i>schizophrenia can be successfully treated with psychosocial therapy, rehabilitation practices and medication</i></b>. Many schizophrenia patients have learned to thrive and lead productive and independent lives with treatment. You can help your loved one fight the stigma of their illness and be free from unfair judgement<b><i>. Let it begin with you providing acceptance and understanding</i></b> and taking every opportunity to correct or inform others that the myths are just that &#8211; widely known, but false.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='3 Ways to Manage Your Mental Wellness During the Holidays' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/3-ways-to-manage-your-mental-wellness-during-the-holidays/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p class="ffb-id-pk3copb fg-paragraph text-left    fg-text-dark"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Holiday season is the best time to spend time with friends and family. But for many people, this time can bring or worsen anxiety, depression, and stress. This can be caused by many factors which may include increased financial burden as a result of travel, gifts and hotel charges. You may also be overwhelmed since the holiday season includes lots of parties, traveling, and performances which are difficult to balance with everyday self-care and responsibilities. </span><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Pathways Real Life Recovery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> offers mental health counseling services in Sandy, Utah. </span><b><i>If you experience one of the above challenges, the following are tips that you can use to manage your increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression during your holiday</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-5077"></span></p>
<h2>1. Improve Your Physical Health</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can introduce some form of regular exercise during the holiday. </span><b><i>Exercise strengthens the lungs and heart and also releases dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and endorphins that have an energizing effect and lift our mood</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. The effects of exercise are felt instantly, unlike medication which can take several weeks to kick in. Exercise also contributes to a more positive body image, which can be helpful for those wishing to increase their self-esteem and self-confidence.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>2. Build Your Resilience</strong><br />
</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You should build your emotional resilience to cope with ups and downs during a holiday. </span><b><i>Resilience is our ability to maintain or recover good feeling about ourselves, independent of the environment we may find ourselves in</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Emotional resilience can be achieved in many ways, but the most crucial is by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Talking to someone,</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> e.g., to a friend, family member or a counselor, because communication releases tension that may build up inside.</span></li>
<li><b>Improving your self-esteem &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> this is particularly important since many situations in our lives, such as relationship break-ups, not getting the job we want, can dramatically lower our self-esteem. People wishing to improve their self-esteem must treat themselves in a positive but honest way.</span></li>
<li><b>Managing your stress levels &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> reduce your working hours, ask for help, get some regular &#8216;me-time&#8217; when you can completely relax and unwind by developing good relationships with your friends, family or your partner.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Take Care of Yourself</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Paying attention to your own feeling and needs is essential. </span><b><i>You must try to achieve a balance between what you enjoy and your daily responsibilities, in order to prevent a build-up of stress and negative emotions</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Consider learning and discovering new things. Research has proved that by simply walking a small distance when on holiday can reduce stress and blood pressure naturally. Finally, </span><b><i>avoid drugs and alcohol to cope</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Even though escaping may sound appealing, drugs and alcohol actually worsen symptoms. </span><b><i>Choosing a well-balanced diet and drinking water over alcohol is guaranteed that you will feel much better, both physically and emotionally</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>
<h3><strong>Pathways Real Life Recovery Center is Here to Help </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If stress becomes too much to handle, people can develop </span><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/anxiety-treatment-utah/"><span style="font-weight: 400">anxiety</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and/or </span><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/depression-treatment-utah/"><span style="font-weight: 400">depression</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and even turn to </span><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/drug-rehab-sandy-utah/"><span style="font-weight: 400">drugs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/alcohol-treatment/"><span style="font-weight: 400">alcohol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to try and cope. <em><strong>Mental illness is difficult to deal with, but it can be even harder during the holidays.

And there&#8217;s a common misconception that anti-anxiety medication is safe because it&#8217;s prescribed by a doctor?</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not always the case.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at a few anti-anxiety drugs most commonly abused by people under 30.</p>
<p><span id="more-4721"></span></p>
<h2>Xanax</h2>
<p><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/prescription-drug-abuse-treatment-utah/">Prescription drug abuse</a> of anxiety medication such as Xanax is widespread among those under 30. <em><strong>Xanax is the name brand for alprazolam, a benzodiazepine (benzo) used to treat generalized anxiety, PTSD, social anxiety, phobias and obsessive-compulsive disorder</strong></em>. Xanax was originally created in the 1960s for use as a sleep aid and muscle relaxer. It was soon discovered that it had properties ideal for addressing anxiety.</p>
<p>Xanax works by calming excessive responses of the Central Nervous System. Xanax was officially approved by the FDA for the use in anxiety treatment in 1981. Those who use Xanax experience an ever-increasing rate of tolerance, meaning they need more and more of the drug for the same effects.</p>
<h4>Typical symptoms of Xanax misuse include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Light-headedness</li>
<li>Excessive sleepiness</li>
<li>Grogginess</li>
<li>Dry mouth</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Stomach discomfort and vomiting</li>
<li>Dizziness</li>
</ul>
<p>If Xanax is mixed with alcohol or a narcotic painkiller, it can make a person fall asleep and cause their breathing to slow. T<em><strong>his can eventually lead to respiratory arrest and death</strong></em>.</p>
<h2>Klonopin</h2>
<p><em><strong>Klonopin is the brand name for clonazepam, a benzo prescribed to treat seizures, panic, phobias and social anxiety.</strong></em> Klonopin is known to have sedative properties and became available on the market in 1975.</p>
<p>When abused, Klonopin provides a euphoric sensation and a completely relaxed mind and body.</p>
<h4>Signs of abuse may include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Slurred speech</li>
<li>Clumsiness</li>
<li>Agitation</li>
<li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
<li>Dizziness</li>
<li>Paranoia</li>
<li>Extreme drowsiness</li>
<li>Aggression</li>
</ul>
<h4>Serious and often life-threatening consequences of Klonopin abuse include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Rashes</li>
<li>Extreme trouble breathing</li>
<li>Excessive depression of the Central Nervous System</li>
<li>Seizures</li>
<li>The inability to catch your breath, eventually leading to suffocation</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Risk factors for drug abuse and addiction include impulsivity, low maturity level, negative peer pressure and unaddressed trauma</strong></em>.</p>
<h2>Valium</h2>
<p><em><strong>Valium is the name brand for diazepam, a benzo used in the treatment of generalized anxiety, phobias and social anxiety</strong></em>. Valium is categorized as a tranquilizer and often aids in sleep disorders.</p>
<h4>Some common signs of abuse are:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Confusion</li>
<li>Blurred vision</li>
<li>Weakness</li>
<li>Respiratory issues</li>
<li>Sedation</li>
<li>Tremors</li>
</ul>
<h4>The more severe and potentially fatal effects of Valium misuse are:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Seizures</li>
<li>Preoccupation with self-injury or suicidal thoughts</li>
<li>Hallucinations</li>
<li>Disorientation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ativan</h2>
<p><em><strong>Ativan is the brand name for lorazepam, a benzo used to treat panic, phobias, and generalized anxiety</strong></em>. It is one of the most powerful benzodiazepines available on the market.</p>
<h4>Signs of Ativan abuse may involve:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Significant decrease in appetite</li>
<li>Trembling/tremors</li>
<li>Loss of balance</li>
<li>Profuse perspiration</li>
<li>Hallucinations</li>
</ul>
<h4>Ativan abuse is extremely dangerous and can result in life-threatening conditions such as:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Respiratory arrest</li>
<li>Loss of consciousness</li>
<li>Seizures</li>
<li>Memory impairment</li>
</ul>
<p>As with any abused substances, warning signs of Ativan abuse include lying about use, stealing money or medications from others and increased secrecy and defensiveness when asked any questions.</p>

Those caught in this cycle can <em>recognize the stages in their pornography viewing habits</em>. From the initial sexual thoughts, a feeling of fear and a desire to avoid watching are triggered; despite these feelings, <em>the compulsion to watch pornography is too great, leading to a sense of shame and guilt after watching</em>. While a person trapped in this cycle will vow to never watch pornography again, sexual thoughts recur and lead to another round of this pattern.</p>
<p><strong>If you recognize these symptoms of <a title="Utah Pornography Addiction Help - How to Overcome Pornography Addiction? - Signs of Pornography Addiction Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/pornography-addiction-utah/">pornography addiction</a> in yourself, here are the steps you can take to overcome your addiction.</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-4583"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Understanding Healthy Sexuality</strong></h2>
<p>The first step in <a title="Recovery Information - How to Overcome Pornography Addiction? - Signs of Pornography Addiction Utah " href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/3-tips-ending-pornography-addiction/">overcoming an addiction to pornography</a> is <em>recognizing what healthy sexuality looks like</em>. For those with a beneficial sexual outlook, their<em><strong> sexual expression is positive and enriching as they both give and receive</strong></em> while experiencing pleasure. This type of sexuality benefits the individual emotionally and spiritually as well as physically.</p>
<p><strong><em>In contrast,</em> an unhealthy sexuality involves a sense of shame around sexual thoughts</strong>, a feeling that one&#8217;s sexual energy is <em>uncontrollable</em> or a desire to use sex to exploit others through power or force in a way that is not consensual. In general, pornography addicts have this sexual outlook as they use pornography in order to feel <em>wanted</em>, <em>important</em>, or <em>powerful</em>.</p>
<h2><strong>Recognizing the Signs of Pornography Addiction</strong></h2>
<p>Common signs of an addition to pornography include <em><strong>increasing social isolation</strong></em>, <em><strong>defensiveness </strong></em>or<em><strong> guilt </strong></em>regarding your pornography usage, continued<em><strong> reliance on pornography </strong>despite the negative consequences</em>, a <em><strong>loss of control</strong></em> and<em> <strong>inability to stop</strong></em>, <em><strong>obsessive thoughts </strong></em>about pornography, and/or a<em><strong> strain in your relationship and intimacy with your partner.</strong></em></p>
<h2><strong>Identifying Your Personal Triggers</strong></h2>
<p>Pinpointing the physiological changes in your body that occur and induce you to give in to your pornography addiction <em>is an important part of recovery</em>. Many addicts experience similar symptoms as they feel a strong urge to view pornography or masturbate compulsively;<strong> these signs can include</strong><em><strong> increased blood pressure, a rapid pulse, shallow breathing and dilated pupils.</strong> Recognizing these changes in your body can provide you with important information that can help change your addictive behavior.</em></p>
<p>In short, by observing your normal pulse rate and breathing pattern, you will be able to recognize any changes that indicate that you may be about to lose control and give in to your pornography addiction. Similarly, by noticing a decrease in your heart beat and a return to normal breathing, you can acknowledge that your urges are passing. <em><strong>The observation of breathing is particularly important as it is the only subconscious function of our bodies that we are able to consciously control</strong></em>. By taking deep, slow and controlled breaths when you recognize that you are feeling the physical symptoms of a pornography craving, <em><strong>you can directly affect your subconscious mind and exert control over your addiction</strong></em>.</p>
<p>A simple controlled breathing exercise that you can use involves slowly breathing in, holding your breath, and breathing out to a count of 10 each time. Repeating this exercise 10 times can <em>help you control your response to your personal trigge</em>rs.</p>
<h2><strong>Treating the Underlying Causes</strong></h2>
<p><em>Understanding</em> and <em>addressing</em> any <em>underlying causes</em> that are contributing to your pornography addiction is an important step on the road to recovery. For many people,<strong> pornography and excessive internet use in general becomes a method to use to <em>self-soothe</em> in response to<em> depression, anxiety, stress, trauma, boredom </em>or<em> loneliness. </em></strong>Addressing these underlying causes can make overcoming your pornography addiction easier.</p>
<h3><strong>Seeking Effective Treatment for Pornography Addiction</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Finding the best treatment method <em>for you</em> is key to overcoming your addiction to pornography</strong>. Many people are helped by <em>Sex Addicts Anonymous</em>, a free support group similar to Alcoholics Anonymous. <strong>For those with <a title="Utah Pornography Addiction Help - How to Overcome Pornography Addiction? - Signs of Pornography Addiction Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/pornography-addiction-utah/">pornography addictions</a> who need specialized treatment and individualized attention, <a title="Pathways Real Life - How to Overcome Pornography Addiction? - Signs of Pornography Addiction Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/"><em>Pathways Real Life Recovery</em></a> in Utah offers the help you need.</strong> Our <em>open</em>, <em>accepting</em> and <em>non-shaming</em> atmosphere provides the <em>necessary support</em> required to <em>overcome</em> your pornography addiction, and our<em> customized treatment plans</em> can address your <em>unique needs</em> including co-occurring disorders. <strong>Please<em><a title="Contact Us - How to Overcome Pornography Addiction? - Signs of Pornography Addiction Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/contact/"> contact Pathways Real Life Recovery</a></em> today to receive a <em>free</em> consultation. </strong>Call us at<strong> 801-758-8489.</strong></p>

Being an introvert can come with some challenges, particularly during the summer months.</p>
<p><span id="more-4466"></span></p>
<h2><strong>What is an Introvert?</strong></h2>
<p>Since introverts are often misunderstood, <strong><em>here’s a look at the common characteristics of an introvert:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy time alone</li>
<li>Do their best thinking alone</li>
<li>Avoid upset or angry people</li>
<li>Have small groups of close friends</li>
<li>Don’t initiate small talk</li>
<li>Make excellent self-starters</li>
<li>Are fine letting others take the limelight</li>
<li>May not reach out to others voluntarily</li>
<li>Are often described as quiet</li>
<li>May find too much stimulation leaves them unfocused and distracted</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>7 Struggles Introverts Face During the Summer</strong></h2>
<p>Introverts face unique challenges throughout the year, but <strong><em>the summer brings along some unique struggles,</em></strong> including:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Difficultly reenergizing after big summer shindigs</strong> – When summer parties turn into big events with a lot of people, it’s often difficult to reenergize and get your balance back if you attend one of these shindigs.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding the beach because of the crowd</strong> – The beach is the place to be during the hot summer months, but introverts often miss out because they avoid crowded beaches where they feel overwhelmed by people.</li>
<li><strong>Binge-watching shows sounds better than going out</strong> – Summer often seems like a great time to stay at home binge-watching new or favorite television shows instead of getting up enough energy to go out.</li>
<li><strong>When you do want to go out, it’s tough to start the conversation</strong> – Of course, introverts occasionally do want to go out, but it’s often tough to start the conversation with friends about a night out together. You may simply avoid going out because you don’t want to start the conversation to make plans.</li>
<li><strong>Worrying your small group of friends is getting tired of you</strong> – You probably have a small group of friends you hang out with in the summer, but you may worry that they are getting tired of you, which may lead you to cancel plans.</li>
<li><strong>Making plans, then cancelling at the last minute</strong> – Sometimes plans to go out sound great, until the day it’s time to head out. You may find yourself bailing at the last minute because you don’t feel like you have the energy to deal with people.</li>
<li><strong>Never getting a tan because you stay indoors all summer</strong> – Instead of heading out for a healthy dose of vitamin D, you may find that you constantly stay indoors throughout the summer.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Overcoming Your Struggles</strong></h2>
<p>Being an introvert isn’t a bad thing, but if you find that it’s leaving you struggling this summer, <strong><em>you can find ways to overcome those struggles.</em></strong> <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pathways Real Life Recovery</a> offers excellent services that can help you learn to branch out more as an introvert.

Whether you are dependent on a substance or a behavior, <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/why-pathways/" title="Why Choose Pathways Real Life Recovery - Recovery Journal Utah" alt="Pathways Real Life Recovery - Why should I choose Pathways?">Pathway Real Life Recovery </a>is here to help bring order into your life by assisting you in your battle against addiction. There are irreplaceable tools in any battle, recovery journaling is a tool that plays an important role in restoring good mental and physical health free of chaos.</p>
<p><span id="more-4455"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Benefits of Keeping a Recovery Journal</strong></h2>
<p>One of the benefits of keeping a recovery journal is the lasting impact it will have on your life. It puts your memories from the past behind you to rest peacefully and encourages your goals and dreams of the future to come forth clearly in front of you. <em><strong>Studies have shown that writing down your thoughts when you are in <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/category/recovery/" alt="The path to recovery" title="Pathways Real Life Recovery - Posts under the Recovery category" title="Pathways Real Life Recovery - Recovery category from the Pathways Real life Blog">recovery</a> helps bring your mind, body, and spirit back </strong></em>in<em><strong> harmony.</strong> </em>Journaling empowers you with the strength you need to overcome your <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/our-services/" alt="Pathways Real Life Recovery - Our Services" title="Pathways Real Life Recovery - Our Recovery &#038; Individual Treatment Services">addiction</a> and lead a happy, healthy addiction free life.</p>
<p>Be certain to write in your journal every day. Taking 20 or 30 minutes out of your day is a small amount of time that makes a large significant difference in your recovery. Writing down your feelings will lift that huge burden off your shoulders one piece at a time, one entry at a time, until every piece falls back into perfect place. Journaling helps make the “roller coaster ride” of emotions significantly smoother.</p>
<p>Pathways Real Life Recovery embraces journaling with open arms. Hand in hand, heart to heart, we help heal lives one page at a time.</p>
<h2><strong>Types of Recovery Journals</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4457" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/1-300x200.jpg" alt="Addiction Recovery Journal Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery" title="Addiction Recovery Journal Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/1-360x240.jpg 360w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/1.jpg 473w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />There are several different types of journals:</p>
<p><strong><em>A Stream of Consciousness Journal</em></strong> &#8211; To avoid restriction of the format of your writing, stream-of-consciousness journaling is better done with pen and paper than using a computer. When writing, chose a spot that is comfortable and free of distractions. Write down your emotions or feelings regarding an event, past or present. Whether it sounds silly, crazy, or weird, just keep writing until you run out of words.</p>
<p><strong><em>Diary Journal</em></strong> &#8211; A diary journal is generally used to record daily events. This type of journal helps you to recognize the daily events that may have triggered the negative thoughts bringing the addiction into your life.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gratitude Journal </em></strong>&#8211; Focusing your thoughts on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal" title="Gratitude journal, Pathways Real Life Recovery - Recovery Journal Utah" title="Pathways Real Life Recovery - Gratitude Journal definition" >positive</a> events of your life are recorded in a gratitude journal. Expressing your thankful feelings can bring happiness and joy into “full circle” for you.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spiritual Journal</em></strong> &#8211; Keeping a <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Keep-a-Spiritual-Journal" title="How to Keep a Spiritual Journal. Pathways Real Life Recovery - Recovery Journal Utah" alt="Keep a Spiritual Journal by Wikihow.com - Pathways Real Life Recovery - Recovery Journal Utah" target="_blank">spiritual</a> journal is a conscious way to keep track of your spiritual growth. Keep your journal with you, there is never a specific time of day or night when a spiritually moving experience might occur.</p>
<p><strong><em>Health Journal</em></strong> &#8211; a <a href="http://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/healthcare-management/working-with-your-doctor/creating-a-health-journal.html" title="FamilyDoctor.org Creating a Health Journal - Pathways Real Life Recovery">health</a> journal helps keep track of every aspect of your health.</p>
<h2><strong>Steps to Start a Recovery Journal</strong></h2>
<p>Choose a writing journal that reflects who you are. Getting a journal with your favorite color or material will inspire you to open it up, and start writing. Whether it’s red or blue, bound in leather or even an online app, let it become your BFF. No one is going to be judging you in your journal. <em><strong>Keep your entries honest,</strong></em> openly spill out your thoughts. In this way, you are confronting your addiction and the emotions that go along with it.</p>
<p>When you bring positive changes to what’s going on inside you, you can change the way you behave. <em><strong>Journaling brings attention to the situations and conditions where you are likely to give in to your addiction</strong></em>. To prevent tripping in the future, you need to remove the habits from the past that made you fall. Through journaling and other activities, such as meditation or getting back to nature, you old habits can disappear. Your life will take a new direction through recovery. The chaos that comes with addiction will be replaced with a positive organization.</p>

We all worry about our height, weight, scars, or the size of our bodies in various ways. However, you should know that it&#8217;s possible to celebrate being healthy, and you can be happy and goofy on the beach while loving who you are. Though it might be tough to feel great in the summer, especially at the beginning, we want to offer some tips to help you celebrate your fabulous body. <em><strong>Here are some tips you can follow to stay positive about your body all summer long.</strong></em></p>
<p><span id="more-4434"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Fall in Love with Your Body</strong></h2>
<p>There is beauty in bodies of all shapes and sizes, and you should learn to love the way you fit into your bathing suit and celebrate the diversity of bodies in the world. There are many different body types out there, not one is the same, and this something to be celebrated. Our world is made of varieties of bodies, not just one type. Your best features are what make you different. Celebrate and honor the incredibly efficient and miraculous machine that is your body. Make a list of all the amazing things it allows you to do like dancing, talking, and even making another human being. Another tip to help you feel good about yourself is to make a list of things you like about yourself that are <strong><em>unrelated to how you look</em></strong>. Are you a good singer? Did you start your own successful business? Are you compassionate to strangers? Can you cook like no one’s business? Take every chance you get to read your list and celebrate you and your body.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Practice Body Positive Affirmations</strong></h2>
<p>Practicing body positive affirmations is a great way to let go of our subconscious negative self-talk, and begin to learn how to embrace the beauty inside.<a href="https://pathwaysrealliferecovery.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/positive-affirmations-to-change-your-life-ebook.pdf"> Positive affirmations</a> are a part of <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/">cognitive behavioral therapy</a>, which helps you replace your negative feelings and thoughts with positive ones.</p>
<p>Some examples of body positive affirmations you can practice may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>I love and respect my body as it is today.</li>
<li>Food is not the enemy, and I thank the food I eat for nourishing my body.</li>
<li>A goal weight is an arbitrary number, how I feel is what’s important.</li>
<li>Life doesn’t start 10 pounds from now, it’s already started. I can make the choice to include myself in it.</li>
<li>Other people are too busy thinking about themselves to care what my weight is.</li>
<li>ALL images in magazines are airbrushed, photoshopped, and distorted.</li>
<li>Being skinny or fat is not my identity. I am identified by who I am on the inside, a loving, wonderful person.</li>
<li>I thank you, body, for serving me in ______ way today. You always take such good care of me.</li>
<li>My worth isn&#8217;t defined by my weight. I define my worth and I am worthy.</li>
<li>Society has taught me to hate my ______. Today, I declare that I love my _____ because of its ______.</li>
</ul>
<p>These subtle body affirmations seep into your subconscious mind and retrain your brain to think positively about your body, and of the most fun in the summer months.</p>

<h2><strong>Look at Media that Makes You Feel Good</strong></h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re constantly comparing yourself to people you see online, STOP! This can be one of the most destructive things we do to ourselves. Social media is meant to entertain, inform, and connect you with old friends and distant family members. Don’t use social media to make you feel bad about yourself. Follow people who celebrate the diversity of the human form, and unfollow those who make you make you feel negative. You want to surround yourself with media influences that are inclusive of all types of body types and people.</p>
<h2><strong>Indulge in Summer</strong></h2>
<p>Make sure that you indulge in summer&#8217;s treats, but remember everything in moderation. Think about what you’re eating and how it makes your body feel. Eat food that makes you feel good about your body. Eating healthy doesn’t have to be bad. Try out a new cookbook or experiment in the kitchen with a balanced diet that will keep you healthy. Then, you can feel good about what you&#8217;re eating. Eat healthy, most of the time and you won’t have to feel guilty about indulging occasionally.</p>
<h2><strong>Get Your Friends on Your Team</strong></h2>
<p>Find supportive friends who love you for who you are, and don&#8217;t worry about the toxic folks out there. If you are spending time with people whom you think are not supportive, then you may need to cut them out of your life. You don&#8217;t need the negativity to bring you down. Having friends who support you and encourage you to be yourself can make a world of difference.</p>
<h2><strong>Wear What You Feel Good In</strong></h2>
<p>Love your body, and love your wardrobe. Wear clothes that fit you and make you feel good about yourself. Also, you may want to consider getting rid of old clothes that don’t fit and have been taking up space. Having an old pair of jeans that used to fit can be discouraging, so let them go and get something that makes you feel fabulous. And Keep in mind, you don&#8217;t have to wear a bikini, short shorts, or tank tops to dress summery. If clothing like that makes you uncomfortable, you don’t have to wear them. You can wear a colorful maxi dress, bright lipstick, big glasses, and floppy hats are a great way to play with summer trends without making you feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-4436" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/Senior-woman-on-surf-waves-and-cliff-background-Crimea-Russia-sea.jpg" alt="body-positive-senior-woman" width="600" height="395" srcset="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/Senior-woman-on-surf-waves-and-cliff-background-Crimea-Russia-sea.jpg 2732w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/Senior-woman-on-surf-waves-and-cliff-background-Crimea-Russia-sea-300x197.jpg 300w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/Senior-woman-on-surf-waves-and-cliff-background-Crimea-Russia-sea-768x505.jpg 768w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/Senior-woman-on-surf-waves-and-cliff-background-Crimea-Russia-sea-1024x674.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Get Moving</strong></h2>
<p>Be sure that you get moving, because exercise is one of the best ways to stay healthy. It boosts your endorphins and gives you some extra serotonin. You&#8217;ll feel good about yourself, and your body will repair itself more quickly. Exercise doesn’t have to be about weight loss, and it doesn’t have to happen at a gym. Join a recreational sports team, go for a bike ride, or take your doggy for a walk. Try to focus on fitness goals like running a marathon or lowering your cholesterol versus weight loss. This will improve your overall health and outlook about it.</p>
<p>So, now that you know what to do, get out there and be joyful in your fabulous body, and don&#8217;t forget to spread the love around to others, too!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='Tips to Beat Holiday Depression and Anxiety' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/tips-beat-holiday-depression-anxiety/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p class="ffb-id-pk3copb fg-paragraph text-left    fg-text-dark">Even the happiest people sometimes experience holiday blues. With so many things to juggle at once, it’s not uncommon to feel down during the “most wonderful time of the year.” Especially for those prone to depression and anxiety, November and December can be particularly difficult to navigate with a smile.</p>
<p><span id="more-2179"></span></p>
<p>What causes the holiday blues? Everybody’s different, and the triggers vary. <a href="http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/2015/10/sarah-silverman-on-i-smile-back-and-battle-with-depression">As comedian Sarah Silverman describes depression</a>, “it feels like it’s coming over me like a flu.” Depression can be as sudden and unexpected as any other illness. Sometimes it hits us when we least expect it – and it’s never convenient or fun.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I can only speak from my own experience, and I would say that the depression I experienced feels like a chemical change," she said. &#8220;When it came over me, when it comes over me, it feels like it&#8217;s coming over me like a flu. You ever just sit &#8230; and you&#8217;re fine and the next moment you just go, &#8216;Oh, Jesus, I have the flu.'"</p></blockquote>
<p>However, there are some common factors you can be aware of that add unwanted stress during the holiday season:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Unrealistic expectations</li>
<li>Constant commercialization</li>
<li>Visitors and family reunions</li>
<li>Distance from friends or family</li>
<li>Parties</li>
<li>Traffic</li>
<li>Drastic changes in weather</li>
<li>and more</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, many people who rarely suffer from stress have reported headaches, insomnia, and other stress symptoms during the holidays. This annual visit from depression and anxiety leaves its mark and darkens what could otherwise be a bright time of joy.</p>
<p>The good news is that, with some focused preparation, you can find that joy again. Follow these tips to bid the holiday blues farewell:</p>
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5">Plan Ahead…</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/holiday-tips.jpg" alt="Plan ahead so you don't fall behind. If you know you will have anxiety during the holidays, plan for it." width="407" height="612" align="left" style="margin:0px 10px 10px 0px" />You know it’s coming, and that gives you the upper hand on depression and anxiety. This season, devote some time to creating restorative routines. Identify what calms you and build that into your regular schedule. Read a book. Chat with a friend. Take a nap. Make these priorities so they never get skipped during your busy day.</p>
<p><strong>For your travel.</strong></p>
<p>It’s hard to feel relaxed when you have to rush to the airport or train station, wondering all the way whether you’ve left something important at home. Get your arrangements booked as early as possible and confirm them to make sure your transportation, hotel, rental car, and other necessities are in order. Prepare extra time to pack and double check your tickets, identification, and medications so you can head out with confidence.</p>
<p><strong>For your feelings.</strong></p>
<p>The holidays are actually designed to encourage a variety of feelings. Some are joyful, but others tend to open the door to negativity if you aren’t careful. Remind yourself that quiet contemplation on your feelings – all of them – is normal and healthy, especially at this time of year. Write down things that upset you and answer questions like “What do I wish were happening instead?” This conversation with yourself can actually help manage depression.</p>
<p><strong>For your health.</strong></p>
<p>We know you’re slammed with tons of things to do. For many of us, it’s tempting to let exercise take a back seat to more urgent priorities. The reality, though, is that exercise is one of the best natural mood enhancers available, and lack of exercise is one of the strongest ingredients for anxiety. Do your body and your emotions a favor and take that brisk walk as often as you can.</p>
<p><strong>For your relationships.</strong></p>
<p>Most of us have at least one Grinch in our lives. Think ahead about how to defuse potentially negative situations with your family’s source of conflict. You can prepare a bank of polite responses that allow you to end the conversation or delay it until you’ve calmed down. Try positive statements like “Maybe we can talk about this again later” or “Thanks for letting me know how you feel.” Then get back to enjoying your day, argument-free.</p>
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5">Make New Traditions</strong></h2>
<p>Traditions are a source of joy for many people, but sometimes our traditions cause us stress. Maybe they remind us of sad things. Maybe they won’t fit into everyone’s schedule this year.</p>
<p>That’s okay. The best thing about traditions is that they are flexible. They grow with you and your family. Don’t be afraid to change things up this year if it will help you heal.</p>
<p>Some family members will be excited to try something new, but not everyone is comfortable with change. This is also fine. Be considerate of your family’s feelings, and make any adjustments to traditions gently and with kindness. Positivity is the theme for this season!</p>
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5">Focus on What Matters Most</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/christmas-depression-treatment.jpg" alt="The parent child relationship is very important when trying to beat depression and anxiety" width="400" height="227" align="left" style="margin:0px 10px 10px 0px" />Spoiler alert: it’s not the presents, it is love and friendship.</p>
<p>Some people will choose to give expensive presents because they have money to spare, but little free time. They may choose to show their love by buying gifts.</p>
<p>Others may not have a lot of money to spare, but they will devote their energy to creating personal gifts at home. They’re showing love in their way.</p>
<p>Both the expensive presents and the hand-made gifts are equally valuable.</p>
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5">Say No Sometimes</strong></h2>
<p>It’s so easy to overburden yourself during the holidays. Give yourself the freedom to say no to a few invitations. Let your friends know you’re grateful they thought of you, but you already have another obligation – even if that obligation is actually private time with yourself!</p>
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5">Eat and Drink Responsibly</strong></h2>
<p>Try feasting slowly; our brains take a few minutes to catch up to our stomachs, and sometimes we feel hungry for a short while after we’re actually full. There’s no need to fill your plate on your first trip. If you’re still hungry several minutes after eating, you can always get seconds!</p>
<p>Also, remember that alcohol can make your emotions more intense than usual. Keep this in mind when you’re breaking out the wine or egg nog this holiday season. Have whatever is a reasonable amount for you, but listen to your body. Relax and take it slowly.</p>
<p>With careful preparation, positivity, and focused attention to your body and emotional needs, you can take this tricky time of year and turn it into the glowing, joyful season.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='How to Rebuild Trust Once It&#039;s Been Broken' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/rebuild-trust-broken/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p>Trust is one of the most important aspects of healthy relationships. When our spouse cheats on us or our best friend throws us under the bus, we’re left with tons of questions and doubts about our relationship. Why would this person we thought we could trust lie to us? Is that the first time they’ve lied, or have they lied about other things? We often wonder if we’ll be able to trust them again or if we’ll always wonder whether they’re really being honest with us. When we’re the ones who have betrayed our loved one’s trust, we might feel as though our relationship is doomed, no matter how sorry we feel for our actions or words.<br />
<span id="more-3805"></span></p>
<p>Fortunately, rebuilding trust is possible, even when the situation seems hopeless. We can rebuild trust in our relationship as long as we’re willing to work hard at it with the help of <a href="/family-therapy">family counselors</a> who will guide us through the process. We can save our relationship and learn to trust our loved one or take steps to prove that we’re trustworthy if we’re the one who is at fault. We should keep in mind that this will take considerable time and patience, so we don’t become discouraged. In order to rebuild trust, we’ll need to focus on the following steps.</p>
<h2><strong>Learning to Trust Ourselves First</strong></h2>
<div class="su-pullquote su-pullquote-align-right">When you or the relationship feels like it&#8217;s stuck and struggling, remember to stop and ask yourself the following question: &#8220;<strong>How would love respond?</strong>”</div>
<p>We can’t learn to trust our loved one again until we’ve learned how to trust ourselves. What does this mean? Simply put, trusting ourselves means being in touch with our innermost thoughts and feelings. It means learning to be comfortable trusting our instincts or gut feelings when something doesn’t seem right. We might have developed a habit of ignoring those feelings in order to try and save our relationship or to convince ourselves that our loved one really isn’t being dishonest with us.</p>
<p>If we’re really honest with ourselves, we should realize that our inner voice was trying to let us know something was wrong. Instead of ignoring it, we need to learn to welcome its wisdom, which is always there for us. This will help us learn how to trust our feelings about our loved one, and <a href="/forgiveness-addiction-recovery/">forgive ourselves</a>. It will also help us become trustworthy by helping us trust ourselves.</p>
<h2><strong>Understanding the Effort Involved</strong></h2>
<p>Our relationships don’t fall apart overnight. We usually start sensing that something is wrong, but it might take a while for our suspicions to be confirmed. Likewise, we can’t expect to fix our relationship quickly, especially if we’ve been in it for years. Rebuilding trust takes a significant amount of time and patience. It might take us several months or even years to fully be able to trust our loved one again. Along the way, we need to continue working on reestablishing trust slowly under the guidance of family counselors. This can be difficult to do if we’re struggling with anger and resentment, so we also need to find a way to cope with these feelings in a healthy manner. Otherwise, they could prevent us from wanting to make the effort to repair our relationship.</p>
<p>We need to keep in mind that it will take more than a single conversation to reverse the damage that was done to our relationship and work through our trust issues. We’ll need to talk with our loved one several times over the course of weeks, months or years about what went wrong. During that time, we need to identify, examine and work on the underlying causes that led to the betrayal, so they won’t come up again. This isn’t an easy process, but the help of a family counselor can make it less painful. Our loved one should be willing to work through this with us, no matter how long it takes or how hard it is. Otherwise, we should consider that they might not be as committed as we are to rebuilding trust.</p>
<h2><strong>Owning Up to Our Actions </strong></h2>
<p>In order for us to overcome a lack of trust in our relationships, we must be willing to make the effort. This can be difficult for the one who did the betraying, since they need to own up to their actions. If that person is us, we need to be willing to take accountability for what we did wrong. That involves doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Admitting what we did</li>
<li>Attempting to explain why we did it</li>
<li>Promising our loved one that we will never to do it again</li>
<li>Making sure we never make the same mistake</li>
</ul>
<p>We don’t need to go into great detail about what happened and we should actually avoid doing that, so we won’t cause our loved one more pain.</p>
<p>If our loved one betrayed our trust, we need to give them a chance to explain what happened. We also need to let them know that we’re willing to work on repairing our relationship and learning to trust them again. Although it’s painful to hear about how and why our loved one broke our trust, we need to hear them out.</p>
<h2><strong>Being a Good Listener </strong></h2>
<p>When we discuss what happened with our loved one, it’s important to listen to them with an open mind. Doing so allows us to hear what they have to say without getting defensive about it. If we’re the one who caused our loved one pain, we should also validate what they say, such as admitting that we would react the same if we had been betrayed or acknowledging that we understand why they feel the way they do.</p>
<p>Approaching these discussions with an open mind and validating our loved one will help us rebuild trust and repair our relationship. These steps encourage us to see the situation from our loved one’s point of view, which can help us better understand how they feel. Family counselors can also help us work on having meaningful discussions and really listening to what our loved one is telling us.</p>
<h2><strong>Putting Trust Into Action</strong></h2>
<div class="su-pullquote su-pullquote-align-right">Practice the three A&#8217;s: <strong>A</strong>ffection, <strong>A</strong>ttention and <strong>A</strong>ppreciation daily. Show your partner how much you love and appreciate them in big and small ways every day<strong><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></strong></div>
<p>Rebuilding trust involves more than listening and talking. We must also display trust through our actions. When we don’t follow up our discussions with appropriate actions, we can’t expect to make any progress. We should focus on practicing showing appreciation, affection and attention on a daily basis, and our loved one should do the same. If we’re the one at fault, we must show our loved one that we’re worthy of their trust. This means we can’t come up with excuses for our <a href="/adult-teen-adolescent-behavioral-health-clinic-utah/">behavior</a>. Instead, we need to show that we’re reliable and capable of acting in an honest manner.</p>
<p>If our loved one hurt us, it’s alright for us to ask for certain <a href="/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/">behaviors</a> from them, such as letting us see what they’re doing while they’re online. It’s their responsibility to prove to us through their actions that we can trust them, no matter what they’ve done. We can’t rely on their words alone to show us that they really have changed for the better.</p>
<h2><strong>Embracing Change</strong></h2>
<p>Although we can rebuild trust and make our relationship strong again, it won’t be the same as it was before. Instead of mourning this loss, we should realize that change is an inevitable part of any relationship. In our case, our relationship has been through a lot more, so it’s understandable that things won’t be the same. We should learn to welcome this change rather than being afraid of it or resisting it. This change is a sign that we’ve overcome our difficulties and can now move forward with our relationship with a renewed sense of trust and companionship.</p>
