<p>Telehealthcare adoption by both patients and doctors soared in 2020. The <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/covid-19-update/">COVID-19</a> pandemic caused the need for a rapid shift in the way people access healthcare. The accelerated evolution of virtual healthcare is reflected in statistics from some of the world’s most respected researchers and consolidated in a data report from Wheel Health, Inc. The report highlights key 2020 medical industry trends. <em>The telehealth statistics below illustrate the spectacular transformation of U.S. healthcare services in just one year, through virtual care adoption. </em>The <em>patient satisfaction</em> data are especially remarkable.</p>



<span id="more-6005"></span>

<h2 id="Escalating-Rates-of-Telehealthcare">Escalating Rates of Telehealthcare Use</h2>



<p>According to the CDC, telemedicine usage increased 154% in March 2020 from the same period in the prior year. Now, 46% of patients use telemedicine for some of their doctor visits, up from just 11% in 2019, and nearly half of physicians are treating patients through telemedicine.</p>



<p>2020 spurred the sudden widespread need for telemedical services, due to quarantine orders and public concerns about safety from the coronavirus. Health care providers quickly moved to meet the high demand for virtual care and maximize the use of online patient visits. Since early 2020:</p>



<ul><li>There has been a 57% increase in the number of patients who have had at least one telehealth visit.</li><li>The majority of telehealth patients over the past year were between ages 18 to 49, according to the CDC, per the Wheel report.</li><li>83% of people who received telehealthcare in the past year said they will probably continue using it.</li></ul>



<h2 id="Patient-Satisfaction-With-Virtual">Patient Satisfaction With Virtual Healthcare</h2>



<p>Sustained high rates of patient satisfaction with telehealthcare have validated this medical care delivery model. In fact, according to a J.D. Power report, telehealthcare patient satisfaction levels rank with the highest in the healthcare industry.</p>



<ul><li>An extraordinary 77% of patients reported that they were highly satisfied with their virtual healthcare, largely due to the convenience, speed of access, and safety in at-home visits.</li><li>75% said they want to make telemedicine a routine part of their healthcare.</li><li>50% of patients surveyed said they would be willing to change providers in order to have routine virtual health services.</li><li>91% of people surveyed said they believed that virtual medical care can help with prescription compliance or keeping appointments.</li></ul>



<h2 id="Specialized-Telemedicine">Specialized Telemedicine Use</h2>



<p>Telehealthcare adoption has been especially high in routine treatment for chronic diseases as well as in mental and behavioral health. By mid-spring of 2020, a stunning 97% of primary health care providers were treating patients via telemedicine.</p>



<ul><li>According to the <em>Journal of the American College of Cardiology</em>, within only two weeks in 2020, 75% of outpatient cardiology care visits switched to virtual appointments.</li><li><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/11-ways-behavioral-health-services-help-people-with-telemedicine/">Behavioral health</a> is the top medical specialty currently utilizing telehealth, with rheumatology and endocrinology also in the top three.</li><li>Of <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/mental-health-services/">mental and behavioral health specialists</a>, <em>94%</em> report that they want to continue providing treatment via telehealth delivery.</li></ul>



<h2 id="The-Future-of-Virtual">The Future of Virtual Care</h2>



<p>Since physicians nationwide were forced into rapid adoption of telemedical practices with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic early last year, over 75% of doctors surveyed say telehealth has helped provide improved patient care.</p>



<p>This outcome is confirmed by reports of patient satisfaction with the telehealth services model, which have been overwhelmingly positive over the past year. As a result, telemedicine has quickly grown into a big subsegment of the medical industry — currently predicted to be a patient care component worth $106 billion by next year (2023).</p>



<p>There are great advantages for both patients and doctors in routine care and virtual urgent care. These include the major benefits of flexibility for healthcare providers to start and scale medical teleservices to benefit patients. They also include the increased capacity for providers to maintain more convenient services for more patients that meet the high-quality standards of modern U.S. health care consumers.</p>

<p>Many people drink on Halloween, but there are plenty of other ways to celebrate this holiday. There are plenty of eventful activities taking place here in Utah that you can enjoy, without having to feel the need for intoxication to have a good time. All of them really capture the spirit of Halloween, and you don&#8217;t have to wait until 21 to do them, or give them up at any age.</p>
<p><span id="more-4496"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong> Enjoying a Lovely Fall Festival</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <a href="https://www.awhc.org/index.php/fall-festival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American West Heritage Center&#8217;s Fall Festival</a> is the sort of family fun destination that people are really going to remember. This festival is open from 27th September to 31st of October; October 18th and 19th are some of the best days of the festival. At the American West Heritage Center&#8217;s Fall Festival, people can enjoy pony rides, a hay jump, a Haunted Hollow, corn maze, gourd launch, and the giant slide.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong> Great Adventures with Haunted Houses</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Nothing says Halloween like haunted houses, especially <a href="http://www.lagoonpark.com/what-to-do/frightmares/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frightmares held at Lagoon theme park</a>. There are seven different haunted attractions there, so you will be sure to find something that you like. This attraction opened on September 16th, 2016 and it will be open until the 30th of October.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong> Halloween on the Water</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You might not associate Halloween with a cruise, but a <a href="http://clasropes.com/christmas---cruise.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halloween Cruise on the Provo River</a> really can make all the difference in terms of creating a seasonal mood. You can see all of the beautiful autumn leaves from the boat, and you can see the gorgeous riparian landscapes as the boat drifts along the water.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong> A Night of Spooky Classical Music</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For only twelve dollars a ticket, you can enjoy a lovely evening of classical music just in time for the Halloween season, at the <a href="http://www.utahsymphony.org/component/k2/1235-halloween-spooktacular-on-the-seven-seas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Utah Symphony&#8217;s Halloween Spooktacular on the Seven Seas</a>. The show starts on 25th October at 7 pm at night, and it lasts for around two hours with an intermission period.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong> Race to Halloween</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you like to run 5Ks and would like to enjoy Halloween in a more active way, you can enjoy running in a Halloween-themed race this year! You can register today for the <a href="http://www.thehauntedhustle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haunted Hustle</a>. Running from the monsters is a time-honored tradition in horror movies, and you can demonstrate how good you would be in that sort of event, by registering for the Haunted Hustle or the <strong>5KRunDead</strong>. The 5KRunDead is a zombie run, so you&#8217;re really going to be able to get into the spirit of Halloween that way. All of the proceeds will be donated to Alzheimer&#8217;s research, so you&#8217;re doing something great for people&#8217;s brains while on a zombie run.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h3><strong> Visiting a Real Haunted Forest</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are lots of attractions for the people who are interested in Halloween events. However, this is the one that takes place in an actual <a href="http://www.hauntedutah.com/haunted_forest_index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forest</a> with real trails. It isn&#8217;t just some indoor museum-type tourist trap where everything is clearly fake. This is an attraction that will really make you feel haunted.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h3><strong> A Convention of Fear</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to go to <a href="http://www.coupons4utah.com/coupon-mall/fear-con-utah-coupon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fear Con</a>, you&#8217;ll really have the opportunity to have some futuristic Halloween fun with virtual reality games and a realistic zombie survival course, among other things. This event takes place on the 28th or 29<sup>th</sup> of October, which should give you plenty of time to plan for this day of street performers and various haunted attractions.</p>
<h3>Free (or nearly free) things to do:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Pumpkin carving, save the seeds and roast them afterwards</li>
<li>Have a movie night</li>
<li>Volunteer in your community</li>
<li>Have a bonfire and roast marshmallows</li>
