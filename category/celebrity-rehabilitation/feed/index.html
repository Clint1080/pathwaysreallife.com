It did not take long for Robert Downey Jr. to become addicted.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Downey_Jr." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Downey Jr</a>. was born in April of 1965. His father, Robert Downey Sr., was an avant-garde film director with a passion for social issues. Downey Senior was also enthusiastic about drugs. In the 1988 book The New Breed, Downey said he grew up in a house where there were a lot of drugs just lying around. Unlike most households of the time where fathers and sons bonded over baseball or cars, the Downey family shared a love of acting and a passion for drugs.</p>
<p><span id="more-3599"></span></p>
<p>Junior made his film debut at the age of five, in his father’s 1970s film <em>Pound</em>. Robert Downey Jr. worked at a frantic pace during the 1980s and 1990s, appearing in a dizzying number of comedies, crime thrillers and dramas. Robert Downey Jr. quickly became one of the most sought-after young actors of his time.</p>
<p>Father and son shared their drug abuse for several years, even as both acting professionals were soaring to new career heights.  “When my dad and I would do drugs together,” Robert Downey Jr. said, “it was like him trying to express his love for me in the only way he knew how.”</p>
<h2>The Dark Years</h2>
<p>Despite his phenomenal success as an actor, Downey was struggling with drug addiction. As his career advanced, so did his drug addiction and the bizarre and antisocial behavior that often accompanies substance abuse. Neighbors once even found Downey passed out in their 11-year-old son’s bed, and called the police before realizing it was RDJ.</p>
<p>In June of 1996, police pulled Downey over for speeding and found three different types of drugs and an unloaded .357 Magnum under the passenger seat of his car. The judge sentenced him to a rehabilitation facility, where he broke out wearing a Hawaiian shirt and hospital pants. The next judge sentenced him to a more secure rehab facility, where he promptly busted out.</p>
<p>The actor found himself in front of a judge in 1999, begging against a prison sentence. Downey told the judge, &#8220;It’s like I have a shotgun in my mouth and I’ve got my finger on the trigger, and <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/09/robert-downey-jr-addiction-children" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I like the taste of the gunmetal</a>.”</p>
<p>The judge sentenced Robert Downey Jr. to 36 months at the high minimum-security facility California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison on drug charges but served less than a year. After his release in 2000, he joined the cast of the hit televisions series Ally McBeal where he played the love interest of the lead actress Calista Flockhart. Critics raved about his performance and even handed Downey a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film.</p>
<p>Police arrested Downey twice more before the talented actor got clean. Late in 2000, police responded to an anonymous call to Downey’s Palm Springs hotel room, where they found drugs. In the spring of 2001 police found Downey wandering barefoot through the streets of Culver City in Los Angeles. After his arrest, the actor checked himself into rehab.</p>
<p>By then, producers had written Robert Downey Jr. out of Ally McBeal. Downey became box office poison. George Clooney and Mel Gibson, among others, tossed work his way but most critics considered Robert Downey Jr. washed up. Gibson said of Downey, “What’s happening there? And you know he’s his own worst enemy. He’s flawed. We’re all flawed. My God, I’m more flawed than he is! It’s something you recognize and have empathy with, but the guy made this amazing bid for life that’s nothing short of astounding. I admire him. He’s done it himself. Nobody else can do it for you.”</p>
<h2>The Rise of Iron Man</h2>
<p>It was then that Robert Downey Jr. transformed himself into an ironclad superhero of epic proportions – literally. He got the treatment he needed from qualified rehabilitation professionals.</p>
<p>Robert Downey Jr. crashed back onto the Hollywood scene in the 2008 smash live action film hit Iron Man. Like the fictional hero, Downey was a wealthy, glamorous ladies’ man who hid a dark secret.</p>
<p>In much the same way as the hero he plays in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_(2008_film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iron Man</a>, Tony Stark, Downey created a powered suit of armor to escape the captivity of addiction and save his life. Instead of creating a suit of strength from iron, however, Downey utilized the tremendous power of professional treatment for his drug problem. Later in the movie, Tony Stark augments his iron suit with weapons created by his company. Downey followed suit by optimizing the protective shell of sobriety with tools created by his craft – acting.</p>
<p>That stay in a court-ordered drug treatment program helped Robert Downey Jr. finally achieve the sobriety he enjoys today. In 2013, Downey topped <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/2013/07/16/robert-downey-jr-tops-forbes-list-of-hollywoods-highest-paid-actors/?utm_campaign=forbestwittersf&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a> list of Hollywood’s Highest-Paid Actors, nabbing $75 million in earnings just between June 2012 and June 2013. Robert Downey Jr. became the world’s highest paid star in 2014.</p>
<p>Robert Downey Jr. not only played a superhero in the movies, he became one in real life. People with addictions of all sorts, especially those with drug addictions, can learn from the actor’s quest to break free from the captivity of addiction and achieve true success in life. Robert Downey Jr. fulfilled his own destiny to become a human being no longer hiding under a film of addiction, and projected this fulfillment on the international stage.</p>
<p>Today, Robert Downey, Jr. is content with being Robert Downey, Jr., and that has fueled the transformation from addiction to ironclad superhero.</p>
<p>“Job one is get out of that cave,” Downey said in an October 2014 interview with Vanity Fair. “A lot of people do get out but don’t change. So the thing is to get out and recognize the significance of that aggressive denial of your fate, come through the crucible forged into a stronger metal.”</p>

This is especially true to Hollywood personalities who are courageous enough to admit that they were <a href="/recovery-program/">struggling with addiction</a> in the past. Whether the addiction is related to alcohol or drugs, this mental illness is not to be taken lightly. When it comes to addiction and recovery issues, the patient needs the full support and unconditional love of family and friends.</p>
<p><span id="more-3048"></span></p>
<p>There are true-to-life stories of famous Hollywood celebrities who won their fight against addiction. The following stories prove that there is always hope for a better and more productive life. Hopefully these stories will inspire individuals who are still battling with addiction.</p>
<h2>Robin Williams&#8217; Alcohol and Cocaine Addiction</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3049" alt="Robin Williams" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/imgres-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" align="left" style="margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;" />As a famous Hollywood actor, Robin Williams has starred in numerous movies and received positive reviews for his thespian prowess. Behind his stellar performances is a dark history of cocaine and alcohol addiction.</p>
<p>His sudden rise to stardom led Robin Williams to use drugs as a means to cope with his hectic schedule. To slow things down, he used cocaine and drank alcohol. One night, he and his close friend took the same drug. Little did he know that this same drug would kill his friend on that night. The death of his friend was William&#8217;s major wake-up call.</p>
<p>Determined to live a sober life for the sake of his family and for his career, Williams seriously sought recovery. Although he had experienced several relapses, these did not stop him from living a life that is free from drugs and alcohol. Since then, Williams has been very active as an actor and continues to inspire many people who have similar experiences with drugs and alcohol.</p>
<h2>Robert Downey Jr.&#8217;s Long Battle with Drug Addiction</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Robert Downey Jr" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/images-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" align="left" style="margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;" />During an interview, Robert Downey Jr. confessed that his first encounter with drugs happened when he was only eight years old. He said that it was his own father, Robert Downey Sr. who allowed him to try a puff of marijuana. Several years later, his father declared that he fully regretted that incident.</p>
<p>Robert Downey Jr. added that when he started using drugs, he thought it would not last longer. However, his addiction continued after his first rehabilitation. In spite of the accolades thrown at him for his excellent acting abilities, Robert Downey Jr. still struggled to disentangle himself from addiction.</p>
<p>Years later, he continued his battle with addiction. Robert Downey Jr. finally took a more serious approach to recovery later on. He said once that he does not really want people to know him as the &#8220;poster boy for drug abuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Often perceived as a scandal-plagued Hollywood actor because of his drug problems and tumultuous romantic affairs, Robert Downey has slowly earned the admiration and respect of his friends and fans all over the world.</p>
<p>With the support of family and friends (Mel Gibson is instrumental to his recovery too and remains a loyal friend), Robert Downey Jr. has successfully lived his life totally free from addictive substances, a feat that can only happen with the unconditional love and support from friends and family.</p>
<p>A celebrity lifestyle often poses more challenges especially when it comes to recovery efforts. There are still so many inspiring stories of Hollywood celebrities who successfully made a huge comeback after their fight against addiction. Macklemore, a Grammy-award winning artist, who believed that if it was not for the rehabilitation program and the strong support system of his family and fellow rehab patients, he would not have made it this far.</p>
<p>A lasting recovery is always possible. Concerted efforts from family members and a <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com">certified recovery or addiction specialist</a> can effectively help a person create positive changes and make better choices in life.</p>

This craziness is one of the reasons why people love celebrities and follow their lives on TV and social media. Quite frankly, stars that are too tame often don’t make the front page or get people talking.  Sometimes, however, celebrity’s actions make news in a very bad way, such as behavior associated with drug use.</p>
<p><span id="more-2099"></span></p>
<p>Through the years there have been numerous celebrities who have attended rehabilitation facilities and publicly struggled with addiction, such as Charlie Sheen, Whitney Houston, Robert Downey Jr. and Courtney Love. Unfortunately, there are still many stars who are in desperate need of rehab to help them deal with their addiction problems. Read on to learn about 4 celebrities who are in need of rehab.</p>
<h2><b>Amanda Bynes</b></h2>
<p>Bynes became famous as a teen star and received widespread praise for her clothing line and acting career. Within the last three years, however, Bynes’ behavior began to spiral out of control. In one incident she threw a bong out of the window of her Manhattan apartment, letting it drop over 30 stories. Bynes was also arrested for a DUI and has been engaged in several fights with other celebrities via Twitter.</p>
<p>Amanda was hospitalized this year for mental illness at the University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center. Just recently, her doctors decided to move her from the hospital to a celebrity rehabilitation facility, hoping that the new environment will be more conducive to growth and healing for the star.</p>
<h2><b>Lamar Odom</b></h2>
<div id="attachment_2104" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2104" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Lamar_Odom_2012_Shankbone-300x300.jpg" alt="Lamar Odom" width="300" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-2104" srcset="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Lamar_Odom_2012_Shankbone-300x300.jpg 300w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Lamar_Odom_2012_Shankbone-150x150.jpg 150w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Lamar_Odom_2012_Shankbone-180x180.jpg 180w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Lamar_Odom_2012_Shankbone-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2104" class="wp-caption-text">SOURCE: blacklikemoi</p></div>
<p>In 2001 Odom was suspended from the NBA for violating the league’s drug policy, but promised that drugs would not be an issue for him again. That promise didn’t ring true, however, and Lamar has been estranged from wife Khloe for months due to his drug use. According to reports, Odom’s wife demanded that he go to rehab in an attempt to save their marriage.</p>
<p>The current status of Odom’s relationship and his rehabilitation plans remain unclear. Reports from various news sources say that Lamar checked into rehab, only to check out the next day, and some sites quote him as saying that he plans on kicking his habit sans professional help. Regardless of the current status, it is clear that Lamar needs rehabilitation to mend his professional and personal life.</p>
<h2><b>Lil Wayne</b></h2>
<div id="attachment_2101" style="width: 366px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/lil-wayne.png" alt="Lil Wayne" width="356" height="540" class="size-full wp-image-2101" srcset="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/lil-wayne.png 356w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/lil-wayne-198x300.png 198w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/lil-wayne-300x455.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2101" class="wp-caption-text">SOURCE: lilwaynehq</p></div>
<p>Dwayne Michael Carter, Jr., known by his stage name Lil Wayne, is another celebrity who would benefit greatly from rehab. The rap star, age 31, is one of the most famous rap artists of the last decade. In spring of this year the rapper reportedly had a seizure on the set of a music video shoot and was taken to a local hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>The seizure caused many, from Wayne’s close friends to news sources, to blame the artist’s affinity for the drink “sizzurp” as the cause of the incident. This drink, sometimes called Texas tea, is a mixture of cough syrup and codeine, and is known for its unique high. Even though Lil Wayne’s idol, an artist known as Pimp C, died from an overdose of the drug, Wayne has still not quit.</p>
<p>Lil Wayne’s representatives claimed that the seizures in March were due to stress, but the fact remains that Wayne is clearly addicted to a medicine cocktail that has fatal implications. Rehabilitation and overcoming this addition are in the rapper’s best interest.</p>
<h2><b>Renee Alway</b></h2>
<p>Alway, a contestant on the TV competition <i>America’s Next Top Model</i>, went from glamorous photo shoots to court. The star, a single mother, has been arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia, petty theft, and suspicion of burglary and fraud. The latter two charges were incurred in a recent incident—Alway was suspiciously lurking near an abandoned house, and when authorities arrived she engaged them in a six hour standoff. Alway’s sporadic behavior and lack of responsibility seems to stem for a drug problem, and the young woman’s family has asked her to attend rehab on several occasions. Paranoia and crime are often associated with drug use, and it seems apparent that Alway needs rehabilitation to get back on her feet.</p>

We’ve all seen celebs like Lindsay Lohan, Charlie Sheen, Robert Downey Jr. and Bobby Brown in and out of rehab and/or jail at one point or another in their lifetime. However, it’s shocking to hear a multitude of Disney stars being added to that list.</p>
<p><span id="more-2026"></span></p>

<h2>Zac Efron</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><center></center></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2027 aligncenter" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/zac-efron.png" alt="Zac Efron" width="219" height="219" srcset="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/zac-efron.png 219w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/zac-efron-150x150.png 150w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/zac-efron-180x180.png 180w" sizes="(max-width: 219px) 100vw, 219px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zac Efron shocked the nation with his announcement of having been in rehab. He’s the last star many people would have ever thought to enter rehab, let alone with such a powerful addiction. While Zac is well known as a Disney star thanks to the High School Musical movies, he’s also been a heart throb for many teens and younger adults. He’s coming into his own now by doing more “blockbuster” and mainstream type movies. Having said this, anyone in the lime light with an incredibly hard schedule to complete work or daily events, could possibly become addicted to anything. While he is receiving flak from many people in the industry and from his fans, he made the noble decision to enter rehab, get better and continue his recovery without the flash of the paparazzi being involved. The best thing he did however was go to rehab, address his issues and come back even better.</p>

<p>Another surprising star to enter rehab pretty randomly was Eva Mendes. While the star of many films, most notably Face Off, Hitch and 2 Fast and 2 Furious. What shocked most of us is the fact that she never was really seen out partying, or doing anything that any of us have seen actors do, that we weren’t too shocked that she entered rehab. She has come out to say that her stint in rehab was for “role preparation”, however we all know she has been in some heavily theme movies that would have better prepared her for the role she intended to play. However, again the best laid plan and sacrifice for her was entering rehab whether it was for a role or not. To this day she has not re-entered rehab to anyone’s knowledge, nor is she seen out and about with anyone other than her boyfriend, making her rehab successful as well.</p>
<p><i>Side note: she advised everyone that the role was for a “female Scarface”; however this movie has yet to come out.</i></p>

<h2>Billie Joe Armstrong</h2>
<p>The biggest shocker of the rocker genre to enter rehab was Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day. While it isn’t a shocker to see a rock and roll star in rehab, it is however shocking for fans when it comes to Billie. While it is also pretty normal for rockers, especially Billie, to be a little out there and act a little crazy on stage for their fans, it was after an I Heart Radio concert that the news came out that Billie had entered rehab for demons he’d been fighting for some time. Billie has since exited rehab with no ill effects so far. And once again we must commend him for stepping up to the plate and taking actions for his demons rather than letting them destroy him.</p>

<h2>Ben Affleck</h2>
<p>The most shocking celeb to check into rehab, without anyone’s knowledge is Ben Affleck. Yes, he in fact did enter rehab! The future Batman struggled and finally won his battle against his addictions and has made an incredible comeback! Ben is a very smart and self-aware man who made the great decision to make his life bigger and better by entering rehab and overcoming his addiction. In 2013 Ben visited Lindsay Lohan in rehab to give her some insight on how to stay sober once released from rehab. How would it be to have such an amazing actor, writer and producer give you advice on how to stay sober? Hopefully his words of wisdom got through to her so she can stay sober as he has for over a decade.</p>
<p>While fighting an addiction is hard for anyone, whether you are a celebrity or not, making the decision to better yourself by entering rehab and <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/">overcome your addiction</a> makes you a much stronger person. Let’s face it, celebrity or not, we are still human and have the same problems and issues anyone else may have.

All of these celebs have overcome and beat their personal addictions. For anyone, of any status there is help for you through the decision to enter rehab, and the ongoing help you may need to see you succeed in your quest to be sober.</p>
