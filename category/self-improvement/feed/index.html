Sometimes the enemy within can be much more dangerous than outside forces. In fact, struggling with negative beliefs about yourself makes it all too easy to lapse into self-destructive patterns. That’s why breaking that no-win cycle of low self-esteem &#8212; and the bad choices related to it &#8212; is the first step to a more peaceful, productive life. Here are a few methods to help you get there.</p>
<h2><strong>Consider the Source               </strong></h2>
<p>A loving family does not inflict harsh judgment on young children, nor do truly responsible teachers and coaches insult impressionable young people. If you were told you were lazy, unintelligent or homely as a child, remind yourself that those characterizations reflect badly on the adult who said them, rather than on you.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: Write a letter to a person from your past who damaged your self-esteem. You don’t have to actually send the letter but focus on describing that person’s unrealistic standards or constant judgment. The act of writing the letter will help you understand how those unfair words shaped you.</p>
<p><span id="more-4772"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Remember That “Comparisons are Odious”</strong></h2>
<p>It’s a centuries-old saying, but one that still resonates today. Comparing your life or personality to the success of a friend or colleague is one of the surest ways to spiral into self-loathing.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment:</strong> Each day, make a note of something positive about yourself. Whether it’s a kindness you did for a co-worker, a new skill you’ve mastered, or even something “vain” like a flattering new hairstyle, it’s important to make note of these good things. Periodically reading this self-positivity journal will help you understand your own self-worth.</p>
<h2><strong>Name Your Unhealthy Beliefs</strong></h2>
<p>It’s one thing to know in general that a bad self-image will bring you down &#8212; and another to identify some specific faults. Once you identify those supposed flaws, you can start to learn how to break that cycle of self-doubt.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: <a title="Changing Core Beliefs, Emotional Reactions and Behaviors - Pathways Real Life Recovery" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/changing-core-beliefs-emotional-reactions-behaviors/">Belief-restructuring therapy </a>can be an essential tool on your road to well-being. Customized treatment sessions help you identify, then address, these core beliefs about yourself that are weighing you down emotionally.</p>
<h2><strong>Interrogate Your Fears</strong></h2>
<p>It seems logical that if we have something we dislike about ourselves, then we’d do anything to change it, right? Yet lurking within many of us is the suspicion that what we don’t like is so intrinsic to our personalities that it can’t be changed &#8212; or that even if we solve or disprove that one trait, even worse ones will be lurking. Therefore, it’s easier to complain about what we don’t like about ourselves, rather than to do something which might fail.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: It may seem silly, but the question “What’s the worst that could happen?” is an essential one to ask. Often, naming your fear makes you realize that it’s either unlikely or easily solved. And if you find that this simple, self-directed exercise isn’t doing the trick, there are other options. <a title="Anxiety Treatment in Utah - Changing Negative Beliefs - Pathways Real Life Recovery" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/anxiety-treatment-utah/">Professional sessions specially designed to treat anxiety</a> are excellent tools in your quest to banish those negative beliefs and their surrounding fears.</p>
<h2><strong>Envision a Brighter Future</strong></h2>
<p>Once you do begin to overcome your fear of failure and explode some of those self-doubting myths, it’s time to expand your horizons. If you’ve always told yourself you weren’t creative, for example, what can you now accomplish, after accepting that you might have an artistic bent after all?</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: Now comes the fun part. Brainstorm ways to catch up on what you’ve been missing all those years when you decreed yourself not good enough for a certain pursuit, be it hobby, career or even romance! Make a list of all you’ve been missing and concrete steps you can take to achieve the goals you once believed you weren’t good enough for.</p>

<p>Externalizing behaviors are directed outward, towards our environment and the people in it – everything from our jobs, to our friends and our families, to the person standing behind us in line at the coffee shop, or the clerk ringing up the sale. <em><strong>Instead of expressing negative emotion or anger in a productive way that addresses the problem directly, our reactions are directed at ‘innocent bystanders” in our immediate vicinity.</strong></em></p>
<p><span id="more-4413"></span></p>
<p>Some of these aggressive behaviors can run the gamut from irritability to verbal abuse or aggression, and can escalate to physical intimidation, bullying, and develop into dangerous or criminal action such as vandalism, theft, and assault.</p>
<h2>Externalizing Behaviors and Addiction</h2>
<p>Addictions can often develop from these patterns of behavior, usually as crutches or coping mechanisms for the individual. Saying <em><strong>“My boss is making life unbearable, so I need that drink,” is another way of justifying the behavior or actions and blaming other external elements.</strong> </em>Some of these addictive behaviors are drinking, drug use and gambling, and sexual activity or promiscuity, and the addict/externalizer will often do anything to remain unchanged and free of responsibility while compelling those around him or her to fit a certain comfort level.</p>
<p><strong>Externalizing Behavior Disorders</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) – <em>Subtype: Delinquent</em></span><br />
&#8211; Defiant, obstructive, argumentative behavior<br />
&#8211; Six months or more of continued non-compliant behavior pattern<br />
&#8211; Impairment of social, academic, or professional function</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conduct Disorder (CD) – <em>Subtype: Aggressive</em></span><br />
&#8211; Aggression and blatant violation of rules or directives<br />
&#8211; Aggression to people and animals/harm to same<br />
&#8211; Lying, theft, and patterns of deception<br />
&#8211; Serious violation of social rules and laws</p>
<h2>Adolescent Vulnerability – Why Children and Teens May Exhibit Externalizing Behavior</h2>
<p><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/parent-child-therapy/">Children</a> and <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/adolescent-treatment-utah/">Teenagers are particularly vulnerable</a> because of the natural shifts and changes in their biology and development.  Certain environmental, internal, or genetic factors can add to those stresses and result in <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/adult-teen-adolescent-behavioral-health-clinic-utah/">externalizing behaviors</a>. Some of these factors include physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, or loss of loved ones to death or removal from the environment. Physical and emotional trauma – domestic violence, instability, substance abuse – can also be huge elements in the development of aggressive or counterproductive behaviors.</p>
<p>There are internal factors singular to the individual, from mental illness or personality disorder to a learning disorder, physical trauma or physical disability, which can cause a gamut of stress and insecurity in a <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/benefits-parent-child-interaction-therapy">developing child’s brain and behaviors</a>. Children and teens may opt to keep their disability or disorder a secret, for fear of ridicule or being ostracized. Their externalized behaviors can then lead to expulsion from school – which is much more preferable than isolation from peers. Results can escalate to arrest or detainment by authorities, and carry greater risk of criminal patters and incarceration.</p>
<h2>Treatment for Children, Teens and Adults in Utah</h2>
<p>When presented with the need for treatment, the externalizer will also often rationalize the many reasons why they <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/changing-core-beliefs-emotional-reactions-behaviors/">engage in these patterns and why they need those behaviors to cope</a> – to insulate themselves against pain, sadness, intimidation or feelings of inadequacy, or to avoid confronting the root issue.  Sometimes the reasoning can be as simple for them as “I feel better when I drink, because it makes me feel happy”.  These rationales need to be identified head on, and the positive possibilities of treatment presented with equal clarity. Counseling, therapy, and sometimes medication are all options that can be discussed and reviewed, but it’s important that not only the individual receive help and intervention – it’s equally important for him or her to realize that a full, functional, and productive life is possible with the right tools, knowledge, and therapy.</p>
