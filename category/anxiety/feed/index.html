										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='3 Ways to Manage Your Mental Wellness During the Holidays' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/3-ways-to-manage-your-mental-wellness-during-the-holidays/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p class="ffb-id-pk3copb fg-paragraph text-left    fg-text-dark"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Holiday season is the best time to spend time with friends and family. But for many people, this time can bring or worsen anxiety, depression, and stress. This can be caused by many factors which may include increased financial burden as a result of travel, gifts and hotel charges. You may also be overwhelmed since the holiday season includes lots of parties, traveling, and performances which are difficult to balance with everyday self-care and responsibilities. </span><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Pathways Real Life Recovery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> offers mental health counseling services in Sandy, Utah. </span><b><i>If you experience one of the above challenges, the following are tips that you can use to manage your increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression during your holiday</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-5077"></span></p>
<h2>1. Improve Your Physical Health</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can introduce some form of regular exercise during the holiday. </span><b><i>Exercise strengthens the lungs and heart and also releases dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and endorphins that have an energizing effect and lift our mood</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. The effects of exercise are felt instantly, unlike medication which can take several weeks to kick in. Exercise also contributes to a more positive body image, which can be helpful for those wishing to increase their self-esteem and self-confidence.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>2. Build Your Resilience</strong><br />
</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You should build your emotional resilience to cope with ups and downs during a holiday. </span><b><i>Resilience is our ability to maintain or recover good feeling about ourselves, independent of the environment we may find ourselves in</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Emotional resilience can be achieved in many ways, but the most crucial is by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Talking to someone,</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> e.g., to a friend, family member or a counselor, because communication releases tension that may build up inside.</span></li>
<li><b>Improving your self-esteem &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> this is particularly important since many situations in our lives, such as relationship break-ups, not getting the job we want, can dramatically lower our self-esteem. People wishing to improve their self-esteem must treat themselves in a positive but honest way.</span></li>
<li><b>Managing your stress levels &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> reduce your working hours, ask for help, get some regular &#8216;me-time&#8217; when you can completely relax and unwind by developing good relationships with your friends, family or your partner.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Take Care of Yourself</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Paying attention to your own feeling and needs is essential. </span><b><i>You must try to achieve a balance between what you enjoy and your daily responsibilities, in order to prevent a build-up of stress and negative emotions</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Consider learning and discovering new things. Research has proved that by simply walking a small distance when on holiday can reduce stress and blood pressure naturally. Finally, </span><b><i>avoid drugs and alcohol to cope</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Even though escaping may sound appealing, drugs and alcohol actually worsen symptoms. </span><b><i>Choosing a well-balanced diet and drinking water over alcohol is guaranteed that you will feel much better, both physically and emotionally</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>
<h3><strong>Pathways Real Life Recovery Center is Here to Help </strong></h3>

While gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer and trans identity individuals are finding increased mainstream support and acceptance, as many as 65% commonly face anti-LGBTQ harassment and discrimination.</p>
<p><span id="more-5065"></span></p>
<p><strong><em>The effects of discrimination contribute to an alarmingly high rate of <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/drug-rehab-sandy-utah/">substance abuse</a>, <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/depression-treatment-utah/">depression</a>, and <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/utah-suicide-prevention/">suicide</a> among LGBTQ individuals.</em></strong> A staggering 40% of those who identify as transgender has reported attempting suicide. But as shocking as these statistics are, the future is becoming less bleak every day. <strong><em>Emerging mental health resources for LGBTQ people are becoming more attainable thanks to the tireless work of LGBTQ activists and increasing support of allies</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Your active support is critical for the mental wellness of your LGBTQ loved one. <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/"><strong>Pathways Real Life Recovery Center in Utah</strong></a> understands that<strong><em> acceptance from loved ones and active family support play a particularly important role to prevent suicide</em></strong>. Be a part of the solution and lend your support by becoming an LGBTQ ally. Here are 5 ways to support the <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/lgbtq-counselor-in-utah/">mental health of your LGBTQ loved ones</a>:</p>
<h2><strong>1. Stand Up for Your Loved One!</strong></h2>
<p>Becoming a true ally can make a big difference in the daily life of your LGBTQ loved one. Life is challenging for all of us, but LGBTQ people often face anti-LGBTQ words and actions that create difficult barriers even in seemingly simple circumstances. As allies, it is our job to <strong><em>stand up for our LGBTQ loved ones by calling out anti-LGBTQ behavior</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Educate other family members about acceptance by explaining LGBTQ identities and openly answering questions. Show your support at work by having your LGBTQ co-worker&#8217;s back and always call out discrimination. You can also <strong><em>make a difference by advocating for company or policy changes that will encourage acceptance and understanding</em></strong> like diversity training.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Respect Their Chosen Identity</strong></h2>
<p>Affirm the love and support for the LGBTQ people in your life by respecting how they choose to live their lives, who they choose to love and how they choose to be identified. <strong><em>Embrace their individual self-expression and stay away from pressuring them to conform.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Always use an individual&#8217;s personally chosen gender pronouns and encourage or correct others to do the same.</em></strong> Research shows that the risk of suicide is reduced for transgender youth whose communities affirm their chosen identities.</p>
<h2><strong>3. NEVER &#8216;Out&#8217; Your LGBTQ Loved One</strong></h2>
<p>Coming out isn&#8217;t just revealing sexual orientation or gender identity. For most people, coming out is a long and difficult process. Each individual will face different life circumstances that greatly influence their coming out experience. <strong><em>Another person should never assume that they understand the contributing factors of such a challenging and life-changing moment.</em></strong></p>
<p>While there is nothing shameful about being LGBTQ, openly expressing it &#8211; or not &#8211; is a highly personal choice. An individual has the right to facilitate their own terms about their identity and how open they wish to be, even if that differs greatly from one situation to the next. <strong><em>Make sure your LGBTQ loved one knows that you support their choices of expression and how they choose to share them.</em></strong></p>
<h2><strong>4. Confront Your Own Biases</strong></h2>
<p>You love and support your LGBTQ family and friends. But whether you are aware of it or not, <strong><em>we all have involuntary implicit biases that can cause us to react in a discriminatory manner</em></strong>. This unconscious discrimination has deep-seated influences that no one is immune to like gender, religion, and class.</p>
<p>While it is okay to make mistakes, it is important to acknowledge and confront implicit biases in ourselves in order to better support our LGBTQ loved ones. <strong><em>Recognizing our own assumptions about gender, family, love, sex, and intimacy will help us confront biases that normally would never even surface. </em></strong></p>
<p>Work on yourself to <strong><em>adjust the way you unconsciously think and feel to match your current level of love and understanding</em></strong> to be your LGBTQ loved one&#8217;s best ally!</p>
<h2><strong>5. Support and Help Them Access Mental Health Resources</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Support the mental health of your LGBTQ loved ones by being a good listener and making sure they know that you are there for them.</em></strong> You can help them find local resources for <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/our-services/">therapy and substance abuse treatment</a>, an <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/lgbtq-counselor-in-utah/">LGBTQ-friendly therapist</a> and make sure they know about the <strong><a href="https://www.glbthotline.org/national-hotline.html">LGBTQ National Help Center hotline</a>, 1-888-843-4564 </strong>to instantly connect with someone who cares.</p>

Today, that equals to approximately 23.5 million Americans. People who have suffered from an addiction and <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/help-addict-seek-treatment/">sought help through rehabilitation services</a> <strong><em>have only just begun </em></strong>their journey as a clean and sober individual. <strong><em>Once they leave the privacy and intensive care of a rehab facility, they must learn to adjust to everyday life that can be filled with challenges</em></strong>. Here are 5 tips to help your loved one begin their journey sober, post-rehab.</p>
<h2>1. Adjusting Requires Help</h2>
<ul>
<li>Returning to their lives requires the help of those who are closest, such as friends and family. The stronger their support system, the more likely they will maintain their sobriety.</li>
<li>Knowing there are people to lean on <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/inspirational-addiction-recovery-quotes/">when times are tough</a> gives people battling addiction hope. They know they have people to rely on when they need someone to talk to or to assist them with steps in their recovery.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-4868"></span></p>
<h2>2. Focus On Positive Things In Life</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/5-ways-change-negative-beliefs/">Focusing on positive parts of life</a> and healthy habits can help make the process of recovery much easier. Having something else to focus on is really an excellent method to help adjust right after their rehab.</li>
<li>Taking up new hobbies and doing volunteer work are also excellent options for people who need to fill their calendars with worthwhile activities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Remove Any Drugs And Alcohol From Their Everyday Environment</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you are helping someone with their recovery, you must be sensitive to their issue. Avoid keeping alcohol or drugs around you to remove the temptation that may pose directly after a rehab facility stay.</li>
<li>Sticking to this <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/377841/6-ways-help-someone-recover-after-rehab">plan</a> after the first several months post-rehab will make coping much easier for your loved one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Help Them Join And Attend Support Groups</h2>
<ul>
<li>Encourage them to attend support groups, which can really help a person who may feel like they are alone in their battle. Seeing and talking to others openly about issues that affect victims of addiction can give people the feeling of kinship and understanding they need to tackle daily life with their newfound sobriety.</li>
<li>Offer to give them a ride to and from the meeting to give them the extra push they might need to attend.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Encourage Them To See A Recovery Specialists</h2>
<ul>
<li>After a patient is released from rehab, they will likely require some post-rehab care overseen by an experience recovery specialist or recovery <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/sober-recovery-companion-utah/">coach</a>.</li>
<li>Recovery takes time and effort, and a substance abuse counselor can help make their transition to sober life easier.</li>
<li>Help your loved one keep their appointments and encourage them to continue treatment even if they feel better shortly after release.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/prescription-drug-abuse-treatment-utah/">Prescription drug abuse</a> of anxiety medication such as Xanax is widespread among those under 30. <em><strong>Xanax is the name brand for alprazolam, a benzodiazepine (benzo) used to treat generalized anxiety, PTSD, social anxiety, phobias and obsessive-compulsive disorder</strong></em>. Xanax was originally created in the 1960s for use as a sleep aid and muscle relaxer. It was soon discovered that it had properties ideal for addressing anxiety.</p>
<p>Xanax works by calming excessive responses of the Central Nervous System. Xanax was officially approved by the FDA for the use in anxiety treatment in 1981. Those who use Xanax experience an ever-increasing rate of tolerance, meaning they need more and more of the drug for the same effects.</p>
<h4>Typical symptoms of Xanax misuse include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Light-headedness</li>
<li>Excessive sleepiness</li>
<li>Grogginess</li>
<li>Dry mouth</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Stomach discomfort and vomiting</li>
<li>Dizziness</li>
</ul>
<p>If Xanax is mixed with alcohol or a narcotic painkiller, it can make a person fall asleep and cause their breathing to slow. T<em><strong>his can eventually lead to respiratory arrest and death</strong></em>.</p>
<h2>Klonopin</h2>
<p><em><strong>Klonopin is the brand name for clonazepam, a benzo prescribed to treat seizures, panic, phobias and social anxiety.</strong></em> Klonopin is known to have sedative properties and became available on the market in 1975.</p>
<p>When abused, Klonopin provides a euphoric sensation and a completely relaxed mind and body.</p>
<h4>Signs of abuse may include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Slurred speech</li>
<li>Clumsiness</li>
<li>Agitation</li>
<li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
<li>Dizziness</li>
<li>Paranoia</li>
<li>Extreme drowsiness</li>
<li>Aggression</li>
</ul>
<h4>Serious and often life-threatening consequences of Klonopin abuse include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Rashes</li>
<li>Extreme trouble breathing</li>
<li>Excessive depression of the Central Nervous System</li>
<li>Seizures</li>
<li>The inability to catch your breath, eventually leading to suffocation</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Risk factors for drug abuse and addiction include impulsivity, low maturity level, negative peer pressure and unaddressed trauma</strong></em>.</p>
<h2>Valium</h2>
<p><em><strong>Valium is the name brand for diazepam, a benzo used in the treatment of generalized anxiety, phobias and social anxiety</strong></em>. Valium is categorized as a tranquilizer and often aids in sleep disorders.</p>
<h4>Some common signs of abuse are:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Confusion</li>
<li>Blurred vision</li>
<li>Weakness</li>
<li>Respiratory issues</li>
<li>Sedation</li>
<li>Tremors</li>
</ul>
<h4>The more severe and potentially fatal effects of Valium misuse are:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Seizures</li>
<li>Preoccupation with self-injury or suicidal thoughts</li>
<li>Hallucinations</li>
<li>Disorientation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ativan</h2>
<p><em><strong>Ativan is the brand name for lorazepam, a benzo used to treat panic, phobias, and generalized anxiety</strong></em>. It is one of the most powerful benzodiazepines available on the market.</p>
<h4>Signs of Ativan abuse may involve:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Significant decrease in appetite</li>
<li>Trembling/tremors</li>
<li>Loss of balance</li>
<li>Profuse perspiration</li>
<li>Hallucinations</li>
</ul>
<h4>Ativan abuse is extremely dangerous and can result in life-threatening conditions such as:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Respiratory arrest</li>
<li>Loss of consciousness</li>
<li>Seizures</li>
<li>Memory impairment</li>
</ul>
<p>As with any abused substances, warning signs of Ativan abuse include lying about use, stealing money or medications from others and increased secrecy and defensiveness when asked any questions.</p>

Being an introvert can come with some challenges, particularly during the summer months.</p>
<p><span id="more-4466"></span></p>
<h2><strong>What is an Introvert?</strong></h2>
<p>Since introverts are often misunderstood, <strong><em>here’s a look at the common characteristics of an introvert:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy time alone</li>
<li>Do their best thinking alone</li>
<li>Avoid upset or angry people</li>
<li>Have small groups of close friends</li>
<li>Don’t initiate small talk</li>
<li>Make excellent self-starters</li>
<li>Are fine letting others take the limelight</li>
<li>May not reach out to others voluntarily</li>
<li>Are often described as quiet</li>
<li>May find too much stimulation leaves them unfocused and distracted</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>7 Struggles Introverts Face During the Summer</strong></h2>
<p>Introverts face unique challenges throughout the year, but <strong><em>the summer brings along some unique struggles,</em></strong> including:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Difficultly reenergizing after big summer shindigs</strong> – When summer parties turn into big events with a lot of people, it’s often difficult to reenergize and get your balance back if you attend one of these shindigs.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding the beach because of the crowd</strong> – The beach is the place to be during the hot summer months, but introverts often miss out because they avoid crowded beaches where they feel overwhelmed by people.</li>
<li><strong>Binge-watching shows sounds better than going out</strong> – Summer often seems like a great time to stay at home binge-watching new or favorite television shows instead of getting up enough energy to go out.</li>
<li><strong>When you do want to go out, it’s tough to start the conversation</strong> – Of course, introverts occasionally do want to go out, but it’s often tough to start the conversation with friends about a night out together. You may simply avoid going out because you don’t want to start the conversation to make plans.</li>
<li><strong>Worrying your small group of friends is getting tired of you</strong> – You probably have a small group of friends you hang out with in the summer, but you may worry that they are getting tired of you, which may lead you to cancel plans.</li>
<li><strong>Making plans, then cancelling at the last minute</strong> – Sometimes plans to go out sound great, until the day it’s time to head out. You may find yourself bailing at the last minute because you don’t feel like you have the energy to deal with people.</li>
<li><strong>Never getting a tan because you stay indoors all summer</strong> – Instead of heading out for a healthy dose of vitamin D, you may find that you constantly stay indoors throughout the summer.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Overcoming Your Struggles</strong></h2>
<p>Being an introvert isn’t a bad thing, but if you find that it’s leaving you struggling this summer, <strong><em>you can find ways to overcome those struggles.</em></strong> <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pathways Real Life Recovery</a> offers excellent services that can help you learn to branch out more as an introvert.

The medical community agrees that prolonged, unmanaged stress can lead to long-term health problems, depression and insomnia. The worst part is that stress can come from any aspect of our lives: work, relationships, our own insecurity or those bills that won’t stop coming.</p>
<p><em>So what can we do about it?</em></p>
<p>The medical community also agrees that stress is (unfortunately) a natural part of life. And if managed properly, regular amounts of stress can even help us thrive! So the answer to stress isn’t to eliminate it, but to manage it in responsible ways that allow us to move forward and enjoy life, health and our loved ones.</p>
<p>Here are nine simple ways to manage stress.</p>
<p><span id="more-4430"></span></p>
<p><strong>Express Your Feelings</strong></p>
<p>Everyone experiences anger and sadness, and everyone gets overwhelmed sometimes. Don’t be afraid to share your feelings with loved ones, and don’t agree to take on more tasks than you can handle. Say no when you have to. Above all, don’t be afraid to speak up!</p>
<p><strong>Spend Time in Nature</strong></p>
<p>The therapeutic value of a long walk or hike should not be underestimated. Taking the kids or the dog to the park is a great way to get some fresh air and sunshine.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>
<p>There’s no more efficient way to release stress-fighting endorphins than to get your body moving. Whether you get a membership and personal trainer at a pricey health club, or simply take Rover for a jog around the block, raising your heart rate and working those muscles is a great way to manage stress.</p>
<p><strong>Eat Healthy</strong></p>
<p>This doesn’t have to mean a calorie-restricted diet. Stressful dietary changes can compound your existing stress. Instead, be mindful of the amount of refined sugars you are taking in. Opt instead for fruit, yogurt or whole grains. Starting your day with breakfast will keep your mind clear and your energy high throughout the day.</p>
<p><strong>Surround Yourself with Supportive Friends and Family</strong></p>
<p>Loneliness and stress seem to go hand-in-hand. You may have a lot going on in your life, but you don’t have to face it alone. Having a strong support system of loving family and laughing friends put the stress of life into perspective. Talking with friends or family can make stressful situations seem distant or even humorous when viewed from a different angle.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/5-tips-manage-social-anxiety/">Read 5 Tips to Manage Social Anxiety</a></p>
<p><strong>Manage Your Time</strong></p>
<p>Don’t overdo it. Schedule your tasks carefully to make sure you still have time to enjoy yourself and your loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>Get Creative</strong></p>
<p>Like exercise for your mind, finding artful ways to express yourself — such as music or art — can be a great help in managing your stress levels.</p>
<p><strong>Do Something You Enjoy</strong></p>
<p>All work and no play leads to stress and depression. Making time for fun is extremely important in leading a balanced life. Read a book, get a massage or play a game to keep your stress level in check and remind yourself what you are working so hard to achieve.</p>
<p><strong>Try to Keep a Positive Attitude</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes staying positive can be tough, but remember that your situation will improve. When you have to stress, just remember what it is you are struggling to achieve. Being kind to others, offering compliments to those around you (and to yourself!) and looking for the silver lining of every situation will help you manage your stress.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='5 Tips to Manage Social Anxiety' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/5-tips-manage-social-anxiety/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p>Social anxiety, also called social phobia, is the fear of being around people. A person suffering from social anxiety often has unreasonable or excessive fear of social interactions or situations, and would rather be alone than interact with other people. It arises from the fear of being judged, criticized, or closely watched by others.<em><a href="http://www.adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/social-anxiety-disorder"> It is estimated that social anxiety disorder affects roughly 15 million adults in the U.S</a></em> and is the most common mental illness in the United States. It is as common in men as it is in women but often affects people around the age of 13.</p>
<p><span id="more-4425"></span></p>
<h2><strong>1. Learn the Facts About Social Anxiety Disorder</strong></h2>
<p>Learning the facts about social anxiety can help you realize what is going on with your own body. <strong><em>It is important to note that anxiety is a normal response to danger</em></strong>, so the goal is to learn how to properly manage your anxiety to normal levels that don’t negatively affect your daily life versus eliminating anxiety entirely. Anxiety disorders are treatable, yet only a third of those suffering from the condition seek treatment. Another notable thing is that anxiety disorders develop from very complex risk factors like brain chemistry, genetics, and life events.</p>
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">2. Practice Relaxation Techniques</strong></h2>
<p>Practicing relaxation techniques can help you to remain calm. When we are anxious, we may be tensing our muscles and taking short, shallow breaths that can leave us lightheaded and more anxious.</p>
<p><u>Two common ways to relax when you are anxious are to practice calm breathing and muscle relaxation.</u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calm Breathing</strong> – this technique involves taking deep, slow breaths in through the nose for about four seconds, holding it for a second or two, and then slowly exhaling through the mouth for about four seconds. You will want to wait a few seconds before taking another calming breath, and repeating this process for 6-8 cycles. It is best to practice this while in a sitting position so your lungs can fill with air, and to breath from your abdomen.</li>
<li><strong>Muscle Relaxation</strong> – This is a two-step process that can help you relax by eliminating physical symptoms such as stomachaches and headaches. People with high levels of anxiety are often very tense throughout the day, they may not even realize what it feels like to have relaxed muscles. You will want to find a place you will not be disturbed for about 15 minutes; an ideal place is a reclining arm chair. You do NOT need to wait until you have feelings of anxiety to practice this exercise.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step is to choose a muscle group to target such as your hands; take a big, slow breath, and then tense your muscle group for about five seconds. It is important to really feel the tension in your desired muscle group, and to only tense the target muscle group. After the tension phase comes the relaxation phase. This involves releasing your tensed muscle group as you slowly exhale and the muscles become loose, allowing the tension to flow out. You will want to remain in this relaxed state for approximately fifteen seconds, and then move on to a new muscle group. Repeat this tension-relaxation steps until you have completed all your muscle groups.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Challenge Social Anxiety Gradually</strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>Avoiding social situations actually makes your anxiety worse</strong></em> as you are not allowing yourself to practice your social skills. It is helpful to create an exposure hierarchy where you write down situations that cause anxiety to you. For example, if socializing with strangers makes you anxious, you might start by accompanying an outgoing friend to a party. Once you’re comfortable with that step, you might try introducing yourself to one new person, and so on. Another helpful tip is to ask questions, and let others talk while you listen. Before you know, you will feel more comfortable in social places and situations.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Lifestyle Changes</strong></h2>
<p>A change in lifestyle can also go a long way in keeping social anxiety disorder at bay. While changing your way of life alone cannot help you overcome social anxiety problem, it can support your treatment progress. For instance, it is advisable that you limit or avoid caffeine. <strong>Caffeinated soda, tea, coffee, and energy drinks are known to trigger or increase anxiety symptoms</strong>. On the same note, drink alcohol only in moderation.  You may think that drinking before attending a social event may calm your nerves. The truth is that alcohol actually increases your risk of having an anxiety attack. Another helpful lifestyle change is to get enough sleep. Being well rested will help you stay calm in social places.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Shift Your Way of Thinking</strong></h2>
<p>The way you perceive things around you has a pronounced impact on your social anxiety. Not many people think of worrying as self-programming. The truth is that it is. When you worry so much about upcoming social situations, you are linking anxiety to these events without knowing it. When you finally go to the event itself, you feel anxious because you had programmed yourself to feel this way. Symptoms of anxiety and excitement are almost identical. If you feel revved up and think, &#8220;I&#8217;m getting anxious&#8221;, it creates a destructive spiral. But if you try to focus your attention outward instead of inward, you&#8217;ll feel more prepared and capable. When in social settings, make a mental note of three aspects of the situation you’re in, such as the color of the room or pictures on the wall.</p>
<h3><strong>When to Seek Help for Social Anxiety</strong></h3>
<p>Remember that anxiety is treatable. If your anxiety is affecting your normal way of life, it is imperative that you seek professional help. <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/anxiety-treatment-utah/">Pathways Real Life Recovery in Utah offers anxiety treatment for adolescents and adults alike</a>. Your specific cause of anxiety will determine treatment. For example, if the cause is difficulty in a marriage, the doctor may suggest marital counseling. Withdrawal from a substance of abuse is often addressed with drug-abuse treatment.</p>
<p>With the right approach, social anxiety is treatable. Pathways can help you deal with anxiety to enable you to live the life you want. We offer common anxiety treatments, such as talk therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy among others. Contact us today for free assessment. We also take insurance and are open 24 hours a day.</p>
