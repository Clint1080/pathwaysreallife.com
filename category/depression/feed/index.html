Our understanding of depression has evolved over the centuries. Earlier generations perceived depression as a character weakness or mood problem. Until recently, it was believed to be a mental condition. Current research findings suggest that professionals providing today&#8217;s best treatment for depression will recognize it as an illness of the entire body. Depression has been viewed as a mental illness due to neurological chemical imbalances triggering various symptoms, including feelings of sadness, despair, and tendencies to agonize and sorrowfully dwell on negative thoughts. But, more recent medical evidence suggests that <a title="Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Parameters in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder Compared to Healthy Controls before and after Antidepressant Treatment" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26579881/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression affects the whole body</a>, causing both physical and mental effects. So, if you are experiencing severe depression, you should seek one of the most advanced <a title="Depression Rehab Center in Utah- Pathways Real Life Recovery" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/depression-treatment-utah/">depression treatment centers Utah</a> offers, where the most up-to-date knowledge is being applied.<br />
<span id="more-5882"></span></p>
<h2>Current Research Provides a New View of Depression</h2>
<p>Depression treatment professionals employ fundamental diagnostic criteria to determine that a patient is experiencing depression. A primary indicator of depression is prolonged (two weeks or longer) sadness or lost interest in activities previously enjoyed. Additional signs and symptoms included in assessments of depression include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sleep problems</li>
<li>Anger, irritability</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
<li>Changes of appetite</li>
<li>Guilt feelings</li>
<li>Weight loss or gain</li>
<li>Anxiety</li>
<li>A sense of worthlessness</li>
<li>Thoughts of suicide</li>
</ul>
<p>There are large amounts of research demonstrating that depression is associated with chemical imbalances in brain regions involved in processing reward. However, based on the clinical diagnostic criteria for depression, it is becoming clearer that depression extends far beyond a mental event only. Symptoms such as weight changes, chronic fatigue, sleep issues, and others are now strongly associated with depression.</p>

<h2>Important Differences Between Mental and Systemic Illness</h2>
<p>The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry published a study analyzing data from nearly 30 other studies of depression and oxidative stress. The researchers’ conclusion emphasized the need to understand depression as a systemic illness, not an exclusively mental illness. This change in the way of categorizing depression may help remove the stigmatization of people with depression. (Having a mental illness is stigmatized in our society significantly more than physical illnesses are.) Some people even hesitate to seek treatment for depression, believing themselves to be simply emotionally or mentally weak, or assume they have been just imagining they have a problem.</p>
<h2>Oxidative Stress and Depression</h2>
<p>The research study found that people suffering from depression have higher than normal levels of “reactive oxygen species.” Those are the unstable residuals of the body’s use of oxygen to generate chemical reactions. In some cases, there are insufficient numbers of antioxidants (the healthy molecules that remove these unstable oxygen species), or the unhealthy oxygen species don’t leave the cell. When that happens, they can cause instability in DNA and cellular damage, which together are called oxidative stress. The research published in the Journal discovered substantially higher amounts of oxidative stress and lower levels of antioxidants in depressed subjects than in the healthy control group. Treatment with antidepressants, which increases the brain’s serotonin in neurotransmitters, had the effect of also reducing oxidative stress levels. The conclusion of the study indicates that depression, once believed to affect only the brain, is actually a disease affecting cells throughout the whole body, stressing them and causing cell damage.</p>
<h2>Effective Help for Depression</h2>
<p>Recognizing depression as a physical illness as well as mental, with multiple potential organs involved, instead of an exclusively mental illness, enables a better understanding of the consequences of the disease and more effective treatment. Medical scientists have already been well aware that depression is associated with an elevated risk of stroke, cardiovascular disease, and the development of serious neurological issues. Add to these potential outcomes, the risk of suicide or drug addiction that often results from the extreme emotional and mental distress of depressed individuals. Researchers now know much more about depression. Their findings are increasingly being applied by the best depression rehab centers, for a more effective treatment that works to alleviate the condition throughout the entire physiological system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='3 Ways to Manage Your Mental Wellness During the Holidays' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/3-ways-to-manage-your-mental-wellness-during-the-holidays/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p class="ffb-id-pk3copb fg-paragraph text-left    fg-text-dark"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Holiday season is the best time to spend time with friends and family. But for many people, this time can bring or worsen anxiety, depression, and stress. This can be caused by many factors which may include increased financial burden as a result of travel, gifts and hotel charges. You may also be overwhelmed since the holiday season includes lots of parties, traveling, and performances which are difficult to balance with everyday self-care and responsibilities. </span><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Pathways Real Life Recovery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> offers mental health counseling services in Sandy, Utah. </span><b><i>If you experience one of the above challenges, the following are tips that you can use to manage your increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression during your holiday</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-5077"></span></p>
<h2>1. Improve Your Physical Health</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can introduce some form of regular exercise during the holiday. </span><b><i>Exercise strengthens the lungs and heart and also releases dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and endorphins that have an energizing effect and lift our mood</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. The effects of exercise are felt instantly, unlike medication which can take several weeks to kick in. Exercise also contributes to a more positive body image, which can be helpful for those wishing to increase their self-esteem and self-confidence.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>2. Build Your Resilience</strong><br />
</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You should build your emotional resilience to cope with ups and downs during a holiday. </span><b><i>Resilience is our ability to maintain or recover good feeling about ourselves, independent of the environment we may find ourselves in</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Emotional resilience can be achieved in many ways, but the most crucial is by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Talking to someone,</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> e.g., to a friend, family member or a counselor, because communication releases tension that may build up inside.</span></li>
<li><b>Improving your self-esteem &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> this is particularly important since many situations in our lives, such as relationship break-ups, not getting the job we want, can dramatically lower our self-esteem. People wishing to improve their self-esteem must treat themselves in a positive but honest way.</span></li>
<li><b>Managing your stress levels &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> reduce your working hours, ask for help, get some regular &#8216;me-time&#8217; when you can completely relax and unwind by developing good relationships with your friends, family or your partner.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Take Care of Yourself</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Paying attention to your own feeling and needs is essential. </span><b><i>You must try to achieve a balance between what you enjoy and your daily responsibilities, in order to prevent a build-up of stress and negative emotions</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Consider learning and discovering new things. Research has proved that by simply walking a small distance when on holiday can reduce stress and blood pressure naturally. Finally, </span><b><i>avoid drugs and alcohol to cope</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Even though escaping may sound appealing, drugs and alcohol actually worsen symptoms. </span><b><i>Choosing a well-balanced diet and drinking water over alcohol is guaranteed that you will feel much better, both physically and emotionally</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='5 Ways to Support the Mental Health of Your LGBTQ Loved Ones' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/5-ways-to-support-the-mental-health-of-your-lgbtq-loved-ones/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p>Although mental health professionals considered homosexuality a mental illness between 1952 and 1973,<strong><em> today&#8217;s professional standards recognize queer identity as healthy and normal</em></strong>. While gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer and trans identity individuals are finding increased mainstream support and acceptance, as many as 65% commonly face anti-LGBTQ harassment and discrimination.</p>
<p><span id="more-5065"></span></p>
<p><strong><em>The effects of discrimination contribute to an alarmingly high rate of <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/drug-rehab-sandy-utah/">substance abuse</a>, <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/depression-treatment-utah/">depression</a>, and <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/utah-suicide-prevention/">suicide</a> among LGBTQ individuals.</em></strong> A staggering 40% of those who identify as transgender has reported attempting suicide. But as shocking as these statistics are, the future is becoming less bleak every day. <strong><em>Emerging mental health resources for LGBTQ people are becoming more attainable thanks to the tireless work of LGBTQ activists and increasing support of allies</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Your active support is critical for the mental wellness of your LGBTQ loved one. <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/"><strong>Pathways Real Life Recovery Center in Utah</strong></a> understands that<strong><em> acceptance from loved ones and active family support play a particularly important role to prevent suicide</em></strong>. Be a part of the solution and lend your support by becoming an LGBTQ ally. Here are 5 ways to support the <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/lgbtq-counselor-in-utah/">mental health of your LGBTQ loved ones</a>:</p>
<h2><strong>1. Stand Up for Your Loved One!</strong></h2>
<p>Becoming a true ally can make a big difference in the daily life of your LGBTQ loved one. Life is challenging for all of us, but LGBTQ people often face anti-LGBTQ words and actions that create difficult barriers even in seemingly simple circumstances. As allies, it is our job to <strong><em>stand up for our LGBTQ loved ones by calling out anti-LGBTQ behavior</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Educate other family members about acceptance by explaining LGBTQ identities and openly answering questions. Show your support at work by having your LGBTQ co-worker&#8217;s back and always call out discrimination. You can also <strong><em>make a difference by advocating for company or policy changes that will encourage acceptance and understanding</em></strong> like diversity training.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Respect Their Chosen Identity</strong></h2>
<p>Affirm the love and support for the LGBTQ people in your life by respecting how they choose to live their lives, who they choose to love and how they choose to be identified. <strong><em>Embrace their individual self-expression and stay away from pressuring them to conform.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Always use an individual&#8217;s personally chosen gender pronouns and encourage or correct others to do the same.</em></strong> Research shows that the risk of suicide is reduced for transgender youth whose communities affirm their chosen identities.</p>
<h2><strong>3. NEVER &#8216;Out&#8217; Your LGBTQ Loved One</strong></h2>
<p>Coming out isn&#8217;t just revealing sexual orientation or gender identity. For most people, coming out is a long and difficult process. Each individual will face different life circumstances that greatly influence their coming out experience. <strong><em>Another person should never assume that they understand the contributing factors of such a challenging and life-changing moment.</em></strong></p>
<p>While there is nothing shameful about being LGBTQ, openly expressing it &#8211; or not &#8211; is a highly personal choice. An individual has the right to facilitate their own terms about their identity and how open they wish to be, even if that differs greatly from one situation to the next. <strong><em>Make sure your LGBTQ loved one knows that you support their choices of expression and how they choose to share them.</em></strong></p>
<h2><strong>4. Confront Your Own Biases</strong></h2>
<p>You love and support your LGBTQ family and friends. But whether you are aware of it or not, <strong><em>we all have involuntary implicit biases that can cause us to react in a discriminatory manner</em></strong>. This unconscious discrimination has deep-seated influences that no one is immune to like gender, religion, and class.</p>
<p>While it is okay to make mistakes, it is important to acknowledge and confront implicit biases in ourselves in order to better support our LGBTQ loved ones. <strong><em>Recognizing our own assumptions about gender, family, love, sex, and intimacy will help us confront biases that normally would never even surface. </em></strong></p>
<p>Work on yourself to <strong><em>adjust the way you unconsciously think and feel to match your current level of love and understanding</em></strong> to be your LGBTQ loved one&#8217;s best ally!</p>
<h2><strong>5. Support and Help Them Access Mental Health Resources</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Support the mental health of your LGBTQ loved ones by being a good listener and making sure they know that you are there for them.</em></strong> You can help them find local resources for <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/our-services/">therapy and substance abuse treatment</a>, an <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/lgbtq-counselor-in-utah/">LGBTQ-friendly therapist</a> and make sure they know about the <strong><a href="https://www.glbthotline.org/national-hotline.html">LGBTQ National Help Center hotline</a>, 1-888-843-4564 </strong>to instantly connect with someone who cares.</p>

Sometimes the enemy within can be much more dangerous than outside forces. In fact, struggling with negative beliefs about yourself makes it all too easy to lapse into self-destructive patterns. That’s why breaking that no-win cycle of low self-esteem &#8212; and the bad choices related to it &#8212; is the first step to a more peaceful, productive life. Here are a few methods to help you get there.</p>
<h2><strong>Consider the Source               </strong></h2>
<p>A loving family does not inflict harsh judgment on young children, nor do truly responsible teachers and coaches insult impressionable young people. If you were told you were lazy, unintelligent or homely as a child, remind yourself that those characterizations reflect badly on the adult who said them, rather than on you.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: Write a letter to a person from your past who damaged your self-esteem. You don’t have to actually send the letter but focus on describing that person’s unrealistic standards or constant judgment. The act of writing the letter will help you understand how those unfair words shaped you.</p>
<p><span id="more-4772"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Remember That “Comparisons are Odious”</strong></h2>
<p>It’s a centuries-old saying, but one that still resonates today. Comparing your life or personality to the success of a friend or colleague is one of the surest ways to spiral into self-loathing.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment:</strong> Each day, make a note of something positive about yourself. Whether it’s a kindness you did for a co-worker, a new skill you’ve mastered, or even something “vain” like a flattering new hairstyle, it’s important to make note of these good things. Periodically reading this self-positivity journal will help you understand your own self-worth.</p>
<h2><strong>Name Your Unhealthy Beliefs</strong></h2>
<p>It’s one thing to know in general that a bad self-image will bring you down &#8212; and another to identify some specific faults. Once you identify those supposed flaws, you can start to learn how to break that cycle of self-doubt.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: <a title="Changing Core Beliefs, Emotional Reactions and Behaviors - Pathways Real Life Recovery" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/changing-core-beliefs-emotional-reactions-behaviors/">Belief-restructuring therapy </a>can be an essential tool on your road to well-being. Customized treatment sessions help you identify, then address, these core beliefs about yourself that are weighing you down emotionally.</p>
<h2><strong>Interrogate Your Fears</strong></h2>
<p>It seems logical that if we have something we dislike about ourselves, then we’d do anything to change it, right? Yet lurking within many of us is the suspicion that what we don’t like is so intrinsic to our personalities that it can’t be changed &#8212; or that even if we solve or disprove that one trait, even worse ones will be lurking. Therefore, it’s easier to complain about what we don’t like about ourselves, rather than to do something which might fail.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: It may seem silly, but the question “What’s the worst that could happen?” is an essential one to ask. Often, naming your fear makes you realize that it’s either unlikely or easily solved. And if you find that this simple, self-directed exercise isn’t doing the trick, there are other options. <a title="Anxiety Treatment in Utah - Changing Negative Beliefs - Pathways Real Life Recovery" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/anxiety-treatment-utah/">Professional sessions specially designed to treat anxiety</a> are excellent tools in your quest to banish those negative beliefs and their surrounding fears.</p>
<h2><strong>Envision a Brighter Future</strong></h2>
<p>Once you do begin to overcome your fear of failure and explode some of those self-doubting myths, it’s time to expand your horizons. If you’ve always told yourself you weren’t creative, for example, what can you now accomplish, after accepting that you might have an artistic bent after all?</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: Now comes the fun part. Brainstorm ways to catch up on what you’ve been missing all those years when you decreed yourself not good enough for a certain pursuit, be it hobby, career or even romance! Make a list of all you’ve been missing and concrete steps you can take to achieve the goals you once believed you weren’t good enough for.</p>

However, not all moodiness should be considered normal. In countries that experience different seasons in a year such as winter, spring, autumn and summer, some people are prone to experiencing moodiness or depression during the same season each and every year.  This type of seasonal depression is commonly known as seasonal affective disorder.</p>
<p><span id="more-4532"></span></p>
<h2><strong>What is Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) ?</strong></h2>
<p>Seasonal Affective disorder is a type of downheartedness in which people who are known to be normal or healthy experience during the same season yearly. This is very common during the winter season. For most people, <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/depression-treatment-utah/">depression </a>kicks in during the autumn and ends in winter.</p>
<h2><strong>Signs of Seasonal Affective Disorder</strong></h2>
<p>It is very hard to know that one is experiencing SAD. This is because most people who experience it are usually mentally healthy throughout the year and therefore it is easy to brush it off as normal winter blues. However, there are several indicators of this type of disorder that everyone should know so that in case the symptoms start occurring, medical attention can be sought. Some of the symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feelings of guilt, fear, and despair</li>
<li>Grumpiness</li>
<li>Feeling sleepy most of the time and lack of enthusiasm when waking up</li>
<li>Loss of interest in carrying out normal day to day activities</li>
<li>Insistent low mood</li>
<li>Boredom and feeling tired after doing very simple tasks</li>
<li>Gaining weight and craving carbohydrates</li>
<li>Loss of concentration</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to Diagnose Seasonal Affective Disorder</strong></h2>
<p>Per the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders">American Psychiatric Association DSM-IV criteria</a>, Seasonal Affective Disorder is not regarded as a separate disorder. It is called a &#8220;course specifier&#8221; and may be applied as an added description to the pattern of major depressive episodes in patients with major depressive disorder or patients with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Seasonal Pattern Specifier&#8221; must meet four criteria: depressive episodes at a particular time of the year; remissions or mania/hypomania at a characteristic time of year; these patterns must have lasted two years with no nonseasonal major depressive episodes during that same period; and these seasonal depressive episodes outnumber other depressive episodes throughout the patient&#8217;s lifetime.</p>
<h2><strong>What are the Causes of Seasonal Affective Disorder?</strong></h2>
<p>The causes of SAD are not known with certainty. However, various experts presume the following to be some of the causes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Insufficient exposure to sunlight during fall and winter can lead the brain to produce less serotonin, which is a chemical responsible for regulating mood.</li>
<li>High melatonin levels. Melatonin is a hormone that controls sleeping cycles. Therefore, if the hormone is secreted in huge amounts, one may be prone to feeling sleepy all the time.</li>
<li>Low levels of Vitamin D</li>
<li>Triggers from things such as use of drugs, traumatic life occasions, body illness and changes in diet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these causes are still being studied to know exactly how they lead to this disorder.</p>
<h2><strong>Treating Seasonal Affective Disorder</strong></h2>
<p>There are various ways of treating SAD Some of them requires one to see a doctor while others require self-treatment.</p>
<h3><strong>Treatments that will need one to see a physician include:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/in-depth/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/art-20048298" target="_blank"><strong>Light therapy (phototherapy)</strong></a> – This is where one sits for around thirty minutes near a light box. The light from the box is supposed to act as a supplement for sunlight during the winter seasons. This light helps in reducing melatonin and increasing serotonin.</li>
<li><strong>Use of antidepressants</strong> – It is recommended that one takes the antidepressants as winter approaches before the symptoms begin to manifest. The commonly administered antidepressant is called <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/SSRIs-%28selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors%29/Pages/Introduction.aspx">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/"><strong>Cognitive behavioral therapy</strong></a> – This involves attending sessions of counseling either as a group or with your partner for a certain period of time. This enables one to think and react differently when faced with challenging situations.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4534" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/Seasonal-Affective-Disorder-Light-Therapy.jpg" alt="seasonal-affective-disorder-light-therapy" width="600" height="315" srcset="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/Seasonal-Affective-Disorder-Light-Therapy.jpg 600w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/Seasonal-Affective-Disorder-Light-Therapy-300x158.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Some of the treatments that one can try at home include:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Taking walks or basking in the sunlight</li>
<li>Making sure light penetrates in the house or in your work place</li>
<li>Eating a balanced diet</li>
<li>Exercising regularly, mainly outdoors</li>
<li>Managing stress</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s normal to have some days when you feel down. But if you feel down for days at a time and you can&#8217;t get motivated to do activities you normally enjoy, see your doctor. This is especially important if your sleep patterns and appetite have changed or if you feel hopeless, think about suicide, or turn to alcohol for comfort or relaxation.</p>

The reason is simple,  Gratitude! Gratefulness is a mental attitude completely independent of our circumstances and it can be developed. <strong><em>For those who are recovering from addiction, cultivating this positive outlook helps assure their future success. Having a grateful perception of the world around us can change roadblocks into opportunities &#8212; the &#8220;bad&#8221; into &#8220;good&#8221;. </em></strong>Out of challenges spring the fountain of growth.</p>
<p><span id="more-4499"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Do We Really Know What Gratitude Is?</strong></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to feel &#8220;grateful&#8221; when something good happens. But is this really what gratefulness is all about? <em><strong>Gratitude is defined as the recognition of benefits derived from something received.</strong> <strong>We can be grateful for an event, gift, favor, opportunity, circumstance, weather, etc</strong></em>. We can also be grateful as a general attitude toward life, seeing the world around us in a positive and productive light when a &#8220;normal&#8221; reaction would not be gratefulness. On the inverse, one can show signs of gratefulness, when they feel none. <em><strong>Gratitude is also about expressing thanks toward others. The simple act of thanking someone or showing appreciation to a family member or friend with regard to what they mean to you</strong></em> &#8212; not necessarily what they have done or do for you. Expressing gratitude helps us remember what is truly important &#8212; friends, family, health, security, among other more personal things. Gratitude should also be expressed toward yourself. It may sound silly or, to some, selfish to thank yourself. <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/5-reasons-to-be-thankful-while-in-recovery/">You cannot truly be grateful toward others is you do not thank yourself </a>for caring for yourself, seeking help when you needed it, learning to trust others.</p>
<h2><strong>The Benefits of Showing Gratitude</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Better Mental Health</strong> &#8212; We develop a more positive outlook, becoming stronger as we face challenges. We can think more clearly as the fog subsides and our immune and nervous systems heal, leading to fewer aches and pains which have been shown to be directly linked to our state of mind. Sleep becomes less turbulent, allowing for longer hours asleep, waking refreshed. We feel more connected to the people and the world around us.</p>
<p><strong>Better Physical Health</strong> &#8212; Blood pressure goes down and we feel more like moving around, getting exercise and doing things that we enjoy with more interest, joy, and fervor.</p>
<p><strong>Better Long Term Outlook</strong> &#8212; When we are grateful, we are <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/7-drug-alcohol-relapse-prevention-tips-recovery/">less likely to relapse </a>into <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/adult-teen-adolescent-behavioral-health-clinic-utah/">damaging behaviors</a>. Someone who may be considering turning back to their addiction for comfort can focus on those things that they are grateful for in order to realize that that is not a path to which they wish to return.</p>
<h2><strong>How Can We Become More Grateful?</strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>It is important to recognize that &#8220;gratitude is an attitude&#8221;. It&#8217;s not an emotion</strong></em>. We have full control over our gratefulness. But like anything, it requires a decision on our part to form a new healthy habit. According to some research, a habit can be formed in only 90 days. First, seek out things to be grateful for as much as possible. And very quickly it will become automatic well before 90 days.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Wake up with morning gratitude &#8212; </strong>Sit in a quiet place and think of all the things you are grateful for before you begin your day.</li>
<li><strong>Write down a list of gratitudes</strong> &#8212; Keep it in a pocket. And pull it out if you start thinking negatively. It can be a list or if you are more auditory, a message on your phone.</li>
<li><strong>Keep a gratitude journal &#8212; </strong>There are great apps available. <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/benefits-journaling-addiction-recovery/">Learn more about the benefits of journaling in recovery here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Reject comparisons </strong>&#8212; Be grateful for what you have and who you are. Comparisons are useless because there is no way to see and know the whole person.</li>
<li><strong>Help others </strong>&#8212; When we help others, it helps us better appreciate what we have. But be humble when helping others. Remember to reject comparisons. Being humble allows for the cultivation of gratitude. For those newly recovering, it could be something as simple as making coffee for meetings, holding the door, helping fold chairs.</li>
<li><strong>Find Comfort in Meditation and Prayer</strong> &#8212; We need quiet reflection time to heal and become more grateful. Whether this is meditation or prayer, make time to for yourself.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='Tips to Beat Holiday Depression and Anxiety' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/tips-beat-holiday-depression-anxiety/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p class="ffb-id-pk3copb fg-paragraph text-left    fg-text-dark">Even the happiest people sometimes experience holiday blues. With so many things to juggle at once, it’s not uncommon to feel down during the “most wonderful time of the year.” Especially for those prone to depression and anxiety, November and December can be particularly difficult to navigate with a smile.</p>
<p><span id="more-2179"></span></p>
<p>What causes the holiday blues? Everybody’s different, and the triggers vary. <a href="http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/2015/10/sarah-silverman-on-i-smile-back-and-battle-with-depression">As comedian Sarah Silverman describes depression</a>, “it feels like it’s coming over me like a flu.” Depression can be as sudden and unexpected as any other illness. Sometimes it hits us when we least expect it – and it’s never convenient or fun.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I can only speak from my own experience, and I would say that the depression I experienced feels like a chemical change," she said. &#8220;When it came over me, when it comes over me, it feels like it&#8217;s coming over me like a flu. You ever just sit &#8230; and you&#8217;re fine and the next moment you just go, &#8216;Oh, Jesus, I have the flu.'"</p></blockquote>
<p>However, there are some common factors you can be aware of that add unwanted stress during the holiday season:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Unrealistic expectations</li>
<li>Constant commercialization</li>
<li>Visitors and family reunions</li>
<li>Distance from friends or family</li>
<li>Parties</li>
<li>Traffic</li>
<li>Drastic changes in weather</li>
<li>and more</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, many people who rarely suffer from stress have reported headaches, insomnia, and other stress symptoms during the holidays. This annual visit from depression and anxiety leaves its mark and darkens what could otherwise be a bright time of joy.</p>
<p>The good news is that, with some focused preparation, you can find that joy again. Follow these tips to bid the holiday blues farewell:</p>
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5">Plan Ahead…</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/holiday-tips.jpg" alt="Plan ahead so you don't fall behind. If you know you will have anxiety during the holidays, plan for it." width="407" height="612" align="left" style="margin:0px 10px 10px 0px" />You know it’s coming, and that gives you the upper hand on depression and anxiety. This season, devote some time to creating restorative routines. Identify what calms you and build that into your regular schedule. Read a book. Chat with a friend. Take a nap. Make these priorities so they never get skipped during your busy day.</p>
<p><strong>For your travel.</strong></p>
<p>It’s hard to feel relaxed when you have to rush to the airport or train station, wondering all the way whether you’ve left something important at home. Get your arrangements booked as early as possible and confirm them to make sure your transportation, hotel, rental car, and other necessities are in order. Prepare extra time to pack and double check your tickets, identification, and medications so you can head out with confidence.</p>
<p><strong>For your feelings.</strong></p>
<p>The holidays are actually designed to encourage a variety of feelings. Some are joyful, but others tend to open the door to negativity if you aren’t careful. Remind yourself that quiet contemplation on your feelings – all of them – is normal and healthy, especially at this time of year. Write down things that upset you and answer questions like “What do I wish were happening instead?” This conversation with yourself can actually help manage depression.</p>
<p><strong>For your health.</strong></p>
<p>We know you’re slammed with tons of things to do. For many of us, it’s tempting to let exercise take a back seat to more urgent priorities. The reality, though, is that exercise is one of the best natural mood enhancers available, and lack of exercise is one of the strongest ingredients for anxiety. Do your body and your emotions a favor and take that brisk walk as often as you can.</p>
<p><strong>For your relationships.</strong></p>
<p>Most of us have at least one Grinch in our lives. Think ahead about how to defuse potentially negative situations with your family’s source of conflict. You can prepare a bank of polite responses that allow you to end the conversation or delay it until you’ve calmed down. Try positive statements like “Maybe we can talk about this again later” or “Thanks for letting me know how you feel.” Then get back to enjoying your day, argument-free.</p>
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5">Make New Traditions</strong></h2>
<p>Traditions are a source of joy for many people, but sometimes our traditions cause us stress. Maybe they remind us of sad things. Maybe they won’t fit into everyone’s schedule this year.</p>
<p>That’s okay. The best thing about traditions is that they are flexible. They grow with you and your family. Don’t be afraid to change things up this year if it will help you heal.</p>
<p>Some family members will be excited to try something new, but not everyone is comfortable with change. This is also fine. Be considerate of your family’s feelings, and make any adjustments to traditions gently and with kindness. Positivity is the theme for this season!</p>
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5">Focus on What Matters Most</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/christmas-depression-treatment.jpg" alt="The parent child relationship is very important when trying to beat depression and anxiety" width="400" height="227" align="left" style="margin:0px 10px 10px 0px" />Spoiler alert: it’s not the presents, it is love and friendship.</p>
<p>Some people will choose to give expensive presents because they have money to spare, but little free time. They may choose to show their love by buying gifts.</p>
<p>Others may not have a lot of money to spare, but they will devote their energy to creating personal gifts at home. They’re showing love in their way.</p>
<p>Both the expensive presents and the hand-made gifts are equally valuable.</p>
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5">Say No Sometimes</strong></h2>
<p>It’s so easy to overburden yourself during the holidays. Give yourself the freedom to say no to a few invitations. Let your friends know you’re grateful they thought of you, but you already have another obligation – even if that obligation is actually private time with yourself!</p>
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5">Eat and Drink Responsibly</strong></h2>
<p>Try feasting slowly; our brains take a few minutes to catch up to our stomachs, and sometimes we feel hungry for a short while after we’re actually full. There’s no need to fill your plate on your first trip. If you’re still hungry several minutes after eating, you can always get seconds!</p>
<p>Also, remember that alcohol can make your emotions more intense than usual. Keep this in mind when you’re breaking out the wine or egg nog this holiday season. Have whatever is a reasonable amount for you, but listen to your body. Relax and take it slowly.</p>
<p>With careful preparation, positivity, and focused attention to your body and emotional needs, you can take this tricky time of year and turn it into the glowing, joyful season.</p>

<p>If you are in recovery, negative thoughts may try to plague your life. These types of thoughts can make you feel as if your life isn’t going anywhere, and can ultimately hurt your recovery process. This is why being thankful is important. Being thankful is about focusing on the good things in your life; the things that make you happy and make your life feel full. A positive attitude has been shown to help those in recovery not only recover faster, but also reduce the chances of relapse. Why? Those who are thankful and positive often:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 15px;">
<div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">
<ul>
<li><i class="sui sui-chevron-circle-right" style="color:#4d7599"></i> Have friends that pull equal weight in the relationship</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-chevron-circle-right" style="color:#4d7599"></i> Have better outlook on the future,</li>

</ul>

<p><span id="more-4278"></span></p>
<p>The problem may not be being thankful, but it might be finding out what to be thankful and grateful for. If you’re struggling to find something to be grateful for while in the process of recovery here are just a few things that you can find to be thankful for.</p>
<h2><strong>Spend Quality Time with Loved Ones</strong></h2>
<p>Your loved ones are some of the most important people in your life. They love you, they support you, and they want you to get through recovery and be successful.  If you are an addict, having family members with you on your journey can help give you solid ground to fall on, a glimmer of hope to hold on to, and the reminder to never give up and fall back. And, with family, even if you take a few steps backwards, they will always be there to help push you forward.</p>
<h2><strong>Ability to Work</strong></h2>
<p>Working and making money makes anyone feel like a superstar. Holding down a job makes you a productive and contributing member of society. By keeping your mind and your hands busy, not only do you take your thoughts away from substance use, but it also gives you a reason to get up in the morning and something to remind you why you are fighting to get clean. A job can represent life after recovery and to many addicts that can be the light at the end of the tunnel that helps keep them on the road to recovery.</p>
<h2><strong>Your Health and Well Being</strong></h2>
<p>Alcohol and illegal substances when abused can absolutely wreck your body and cause a multitude of health issues. Substance abuse can turn anyone into a shell of who they once were, not only showing physical signs but emotional and mental signs as well. By going into recovery, you are reclaiming your physical, mental, and emotional health and saying you want to be in control. Poor health equals poor life quality, and if you are thankful for the chance to regain all aspects of good health you are that much more likely to be successful in your recovery program.</p>
<h2><strong>Helping Others</strong></h2>
<p>When on substances of any kind it changes you as a person. You may can become impatient, mean, or even completely self-absorbed. This means that you will miss out on some of the simple things in life, such as helping prepare a family dinner, doing homework with your kids, or participating in volunteer activities. These activities can help fill up those empty spots in your life that would otherwise have been filled with getting high or drunk; instead you can relish in the fact that you are helping someone else complete a task they may not have been able to do without you. And, once you are completely recovered, reminding yourself about your ability to help and contribute to society can help keep you on the straight and narrow.</p>
<h2><strong>Having Fun</strong></h2>
<p>Addiction takes up all your free time, it sucks away at your life, and becomes an all-consuming activity. It turns star athletes into couch potatoes, fun loving young adults into zombies, and can take almost anyone away from the things they love. When you aren’t sober, you don’t have a chance to enjoy the activities in life that you once found fun. During recovery try and find time to do these things again. Pick up your favorite book, get back to scrapbooking, or take up a sport you haven’t played in a long time. These activities will help fill that void that substances took up for the longest time, it can get you out of your own head, and can help give you a more positive outlook. Be thankful for fun and the fact that in recovery you can enjoy things once again, instead of locking yourself away in the dark looking for your next high.</p>

<h2><strong>Attitude of Gratitude: The Pathways Difference</strong></h2>
<p>One of the most important things you can do during your time in recovery is to never give up and to continuously look on the bright side. By taking in all the wonderful things in your life you can reject the negative and put yourself on a bright, and beautiful path for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com">Pathways</a> we know how hard it can be to be thankful for the things in your life, and to stay positive during the dark times that recovery may sometimes bring. This is why at Pathways we find a REAL solution to help you recover quickly and easily. We work with your family too! Recovery doesn’t just hurt you and your body, it can also be taxing for your immediate family, and we understand that. We work with the entire family unit to make it healthy and help it function properly again. We use techniques that will help you in the real world to not only overcome your addiction, but keep it from invading your life again.</p>
<p>Pathways knows that the road to recovery is seldom an easy one, but we also know that the benefits of getting clean and sober greatly outweigh staying dependent on substances. Getting clean can make you a better person with a great life. <a href="/programs/">Recovery is waiting</a> for you so never give up.</p>
