										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='Benefits of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT)' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/benefits-parent-child-interaction-therapy/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p class="ffb-id-pk3copb fg-paragraph text-left    fg-text-dark">If your young child is experiencing <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/adult-teen-adolescent-behavioral-health-clinic-utah/" title="Behavioral Health Treatment for Adults and Teens in Utah - Parent-Child Interaction Therapy near Salt Lake City Utah">behavioral problems</a>, you have likely tried many methods to attempt to correct these behaviors. Some of these methods may include punishment techniques or positive reinforcement methods. However, if you are not seeing any change in their behavior, you may begin to wonder what you as a parent are doing wrong.</p>
<p><span id="more-4347"></span></p>
<p>Despite your best efforts to remain calm and composed, parents can become tired and irritable when they are subjected to the same behaviors from their child over and over. When this happens, you may not act in such a way that we are making a positive impact on our child as they are disciplined. Unfortunately, your child can then pick up on your bad habits and mirror them, which may be part of the reason that they are acting out, because they see you doing so when you are frustrated. A parent&#8217;s frustration and stress directly relate to our children&#8217;s ability to <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/belief-restructuring/" title="Belief Restructuring Therapy - Parent-Child Interaction Therapist in Utah">process and react to their feelings and behaviors</a>. If you are in this situation, parent-child interaction therapy, or PCIT, may be ideal for you.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4344" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-child-interaction-therapy-pcit-utah.jpg" alt="Parent Child Interaction Therapy" width="600" height="400" title="Experience the benefits of parent child relationship therapy, call Pathways Real Life Recovery today - Parent Child Interaction Therapy in Utah" /><br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<p><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/parent-child-therapy/" title="Parent-child Interaction Therapy near Salt Lake City Utah - What are the benefits of parent child relationship therapy?">Parent-child interaction therapy</a> is a form of therapy for you, the parent. You receive coaching from a child psychology specialist on how to decrease your negative behaviors while improving upon your relationship with your child. This can help to curb behavioral problems in a child. PCIT is a specialized 15-20 session treatment program designed for parents or caregivers and their children aged 10 or younger who may be experiencing behavioral and/or emotional issues. Sessions are an hour long and are done weekly.</p>
<h2>Helps Children Manage Aggressive and Defiant Behaviors</h2>
<p>Parent-child interaction counseling helps target a wide range of <a href="http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/aggression/according-experts/effective-daycare-kindergarten-interventions-prevent-chronic-aggression">aggressive</a> and defiant behaviors in children. Some of those behaviors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swearing</li>
<li>Fighting</li>
<li>Temper tantrums</li>
<li>Refusal to obey rules</li>
<li>Arguing</li>
<li>Low self-esteem</li>
<li>Low frustration threshold</li>
<li>Lying</li>
<li>Blaming others for one&#8217;s actions</li>
</ul>
<p>With such a wide array of behaviors, you may be wondering how this type of counseling can help to solve all of these problems. In order to properly solve behavioral issues, you have to get to the root of the issue with the child. Most of the time, the behavior is one that is learned from the parent and the parent may inadvertently be doing so. For example, when you discipline your child, and they talk back, you may engage with them and argue. If you let them get away with this a couple of times, the habit is formed and it is hard to break without outside assistance. Learning how to break some of these bad habits, and learning techniques to follow yourself when you feel frustrated, will help your child see how to behave in situations. Over time, they will learn by your positive example.</p>
<div class="su-quote su-quote-style-default su-quote-has-cite"><div class="su-quote-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim">Research has shown that, as a result of PCIT, parents learn more effective parenting techniques, the behavior problem of children decrease, and the quality of the parent-child relationship improves.<span class="su-quote-cite">(U.S. Department of Human and Health Services, 2015)</span></div></div>
<h2>Helps Improve Parent-Child Relationships</h2>
<p>One of the biggest benefits to parent-child interaction therapy is that you can improve upon your relationship with your child. Many parents would love a better relationship with their child, but they simply don&#8217;t know how. This type of program teaches you how to communicate with and respect your child, while still asserting your parental position. Creating and establishing a positive relationship is much easier in younger children, so the earlier you start, the better.</p>
<h2>Helps Reduce Child Abuse</h2>
<p>The last benefit to parent-child interaction therapy is that it helps to <a href="http://encompassnw.org/parent-child-interaction-therapy-decreases-tension-and-improves-relationships/">reduce child abuse</a>. When parents are frustrated, they can say things that can be hurtful and emotionally abusive to a child. Unfortunately, they may not even realize because that&#8217;s how they were disciplined as a child. PCIT breaks the cycle of abuse and teaches you how to parent without emotionally or physically abusing your child.</p>

While gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer and trans identity individuals are finding increased mainstream support and acceptance, as many as 65% commonly face anti-LGBTQ harassment and discrimination.</p>
<p><span id="more-5065"></span></p>
<p><strong><em>The effects of discrimination contribute to an alarmingly high rate of <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/drug-rehab-sandy-utah/">substance abuse</a>, <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/depression-treatment-utah/">depression</a>, and <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/utah-suicide-prevention/">suicide</a> among LGBTQ individuals.</em></strong> A staggering 40% of those who identify as transgender has reported attempting suicide. But as shocking as these statistics are, the future is becoming less bleak every day. <strong><em>Emerging mental health resources for LGBTQ people are becoming more attainable thanks to the tireless work of LGBTQ activists and increasing support of allies</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Your active support is critical for the mental wellness of your LGBTQ loved one. <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/"><strong>Pathways Real Life Recovery Center in Utah</strong></a> understands that<strong><em> acceptance from loved ones and active family support play a particularly important role to prevent suicide</em></strong>. Be a part of the solution and lend your support by becoming an LGBTQ ally. Here are 5 ways to support the <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/lgbtq-counselor-in-utah/">mental health of your LGBTQ loved ones</a>:</p>
<h2><strong>1. Stand Up for Your Loved One!</strong></h2>
<p>Becoming a true ally can make a big difference in the daily life of your LGBTQ loved one. Life is challenging for all of us, but LGBTQ people often face anti-LGBTQ words and actions that create difficult barriers even in seemingly simple circumstances. As allies, it is our job to <strong><em>stand up for our LGBTQ loved ones by calling out anti-LGBTQ behavior</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Educate other family members about acceptance by explaining LGBTQ identities and openly answering questions. Show your support at work by having your LGBTQ co-worker&#8217;s back and always call out discrimination. You can also <strong><em>make a difference by advocating for company or policy changes that will encourage acceptance and understanding</em></strong> like diversity training.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Respect Their Chosen Identity</strong></h2>
<p>Affirm the love and support for the LGBTQ people in your life by respecting how they choose to live their lives, who they choose to love and how they choose to be identified. <strong><em>Embrace their individual self-expression and stay away from pressuring them to conform.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Always use an individual&#8217;s personally chosen gender pronouns and encourage or correct others to do the same.</em></strong> Research shows that the risk of suicide is reduced for transgender youth whose communities affirm their chosen identities.</p>
<h2><strong>3. NEVER &#8216;Out&#8217; Your LGBTQ Loved One</strong></h2>
<p>Coming out isn&#8217;t just revealing sexual orientation or gender identity. For most people, coming out is a long and difficult process. Each individual will face different life circumstances that greatly influence their coming out experience. <strong><em>Another person should never assume that they understand the contributing factors of such a challenging and life-changing moment.</em></strong></p>
<p>While there is nothing shameful about being LGBTQ, openly expressing it &#8211; or not &#8211; is a highly personal choice. An individual has the right to facilitate their own terms about their identity and how open they wish to be, even if that differs greatly from one situation to the next. <strong><em>Make sure your LGBTQ loved one knows that you support their choices of expression and how they choose to share them.</em></strong></p>
<h2><strong>4. Confront Your Own Biases</strong></h2>
<p>You love and support your LGBTQ family and friends. But whether you are aware of it or not, <strong><em>we all have involuntary implicit biases that can cause us to react in a discriminatory manner</em></strong>. This unconscious discrimination has deep-seated influences that no one is immune to like gender, religion, and class.</p>
<p>While it is okay to make mistakes, it is important to acknowledge and confront implicit biases in ourselves in order to better support our LGBTQ loved ones. <strong><em>Recognizing our own assumptions about gender, family, love, sex, and intimacy will help us confront biases that normally would never even surface. </em></strong></p>
<p>Work on yourself to <strong><em>adjust the way you unconsciously think and feel to match your current level of love and understanding</em></strong> to be your LGBTQ loved one&#8217;s best ally!</p>
<h2><strong>5. Support and Help Them Access Mental Health Resources</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Support the mental health of your LGBTQ loved ones by being a good listener and making sure they know that you are there for them.</em></strong> You can help them find local resources for <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/our-services/">therapy and substance abuse treatment</a>, an <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/lgbtq-counselor-in-utah/">LGBTQ-friendly therapist</a> and make sure they know about the <strong><a href="https://www.glbthotline.org/national-hotline.html">LGBTQ National Help Center hotline</a>, 1-888-843-4564 </strong>to instantly connect with someone who cares.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='Teen Suicide Prevention' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/teen-suicide-prevention/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p><a title="Suicide - How To Help A Teenager With Suicidal Thoughts - Pathways Real Life Recovery" href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/suicide.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Per the Center for Disease Control more than 5,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 took their own lives in 2015</a>, making it the second most common cause of death in that age group. It was also the third most common cause for people aged between 10 and 14. High teen suicide rates mean that young people of all social backgrounds and ethnicities are at risk, and these tragedies are also indiscriminate to gender. Although boys are more likely to succeed in taking their own lives, the evidence shows that girls are at least as likely to attempt to do so.<br />
<span id="more-4843"></span></p>
<p>In a time of increasing social and economic pressures, and ever-present social media, it may seem more difficult than ever to protect the mental health of our young people, but fortunately there are a number of ways to prevent teen suicide which are very effective if the necessary steps are taken when the first early warning signs become visible.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Recognize the Warning Signs</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Verbal Clues </strong> &#8211; If a teen, or anyone, talks directly about suicide or death, then, of course, it should be an immediate cause for concern. Such direct references may include discussing the methods which might be used, as well as how to obtain drugs or weapons. But there are also less obvious verbal signals that you should be aware of. <strong><em>Phrases such as “if anything happens to me”, or “always remember that I love you”</em></strong>, may well be innocuous, especially if said as a one-off, and signal no more than a passing mood. But if they are repeated often they may be an early warning of a developing problem. Young people who are beginning to experience mental health problems may also express a persistent feeling of worthlessness, hopelessness, and despair for the future, of an intensity which goes far beyond normal “adolescent blues”.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<div class="infobox" style="background-color: #fffac6; border-color: #d3c200;padding:20px;">
<p><strong style="font-size:20px;">Attention:</strong></p>
<p><strong> If you are in crisis, call the toll-free National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or text TALK to 741741.</strong></p>
<p> &#8211; Available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</br></p>
<p>Frequent complaints of tiredness, head or stomach aches or muscular pains from individuals who appear physically healthy are another common indicator of potential problems.</p>
<p><img title="Teen Suicide Prevention in Utah-  Pathways Real Life Recovery" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/teen-suicide-prevention-1.jpg" alt="Girl on a Mobile Phone - Teenagers and Suicide Prevention - Pathways Real Life Recovery in Utah" width="100%" /><br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<p><strong>Behavioral Cues</strong> &#8211; But even more important, perhaps, than what emotionally troubled young people say, are the behavioral changes they may display. It is very common for potentially suicidal teens to become socially withdrawn. So <strong><em>previously happy, outgoing and sociable young people with many friends may begin to turn down invitations, refuse to participate in family, social or sports activities and be resistant or even hostile when encouraged to do so.</em></strong></p>
<p>Other signs may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>declining performance at school or work, and problems with attendance</li>
<li>Teens who begin to use drugs and/or alcohol, or whose eating, sleep and exercise habits change without explanation</li>
<li>neglect of personal appearance and hygiene</li>
<li>Unpredictable and extreme mood swings and apathy being followed quickly by anger, rebellion, deliberately disruptive behavior or even violence.</li>
<li>Driving at excessive speed and other deliberate high-risk behaviors are also warning signals to look for.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Why it’s Hard to Tell if a Teen is at Risk</strong></h2>
<p>One of the main difficulties in preventing teen suicide is that many of these symptoms or behavioral issues are of course quite common in adolescents. And thankfully, most “moody” teens are simply going through a normal phase of their development and are not and never will be suicidal. So even the closest of families or friends may find it difficult to determine when a loved one’s behavior is departing from the norm and should be a cause for concern. <strong><em>“Better safe than sorry” is a wise approach in these circumstances. You don’t need to try and deal with this on your own. Trust your instincts and seek the advice of a suitably qualified professional if you’re in any doubt at all</em></strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Talk with Someone You’re Worried About</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>First, be aware that if you’re worried that a teen close to you may be thinking about suicide, it’s ok to ask them directly about it.</em></strong> Many parents and friends worry that by doing so they may risk somehow creating the idea in that young person’s mind. <strong><em>But all the evidence suggests that talking openly about suicide reduces the risk that a person will act on the idea</em></strong>. If someone is displaying the signs discussed above, but is not talking explicitly about suicide or self-harm, a warm empathetic approach is important. Acknowledge and validate the feelings of the person in a non-judgmental way. Demanding that they “pull themselves together” or “start shaping up”, is seldom, if ever helpful. If a teen is resistant to engaging in conversation and unresponsive to questions, try to avoid showing any frustration you may feel. Staying close by as a silent but comforting presence can also be helpful.</p>
<h2><strong>Suggesting Treatment or Therapy </strong></h2>
<p>However difficult it may sometimes be, it’s crucial to keep lines of communication open. Talk regularly to the person you’re concerned about, however unresponsive they may be, and make sure they know that you’re there to support and help in any way they need. <strong><em>If you believe the person may have formed a definite plan to harm themselves or if they have begun to behave erratically or irrationally, you should seek immediate help, including calling 911 in extreme cases.</em></strong> But even in less urgent situations, don’t be afraid to ask for professional advice. You need it for your own good as much as for that of the person at risk, and their safety and welfare should outweigh any guilt you may feel about breaching their confidence.</p>
<h2><strong>Helping Suicidal Teens</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offer help and listen</strong>. Encourage depressed teens to talk about their feelings. Listen, don’t lecture.</li>
<li><strong>Trust your instincts</strong>. If it seems that the situation may be serious, seek prompt help. Break a confidence if necessary, in order to save a life.</li>
<li><strong>Pay attention to talk about suicide</strong>. Ask direct questions and don’t be afraid of frank discussions. Silence is deadly!</li>
<li><strong>Seek professional help</strong>. It is essential to seek expert advice from a mental health professional who has experience helping depressed teens. Also, alert key adults in the teen’s life — family, friends and teachers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Probably the most important thing for parents and friends to do, at least in the early stages of a developing problem, is to be as aware and supportive as possible. This means encouraging and rewarding positive social interactions such as sports, arts or music activities. But you also need to try to be as aware as possible of your teen’s environment. This may mean monitoring social media use, as un-intrusively as possible, talking to their friends and the parents of their friends, and developing close relationships with teachers and coaches. You will also want to monitor alcohol and other substance use, including any prescription medications, and if necessary try to restrict access to them in a non-confrontational way. These kinds of tactics often prove successful in helping teens through difficult but normal phases of development. But if you feel at any time that you cannot cope or are risk of losing control of the situation, you need to consult an experienced professional as soon as possible.</p>
<h2><strong>Professional Therapy for Teen Suicide Prevention</strong></h2>
<p>A wide range of different therapies is available depending on an individual’s particular needs.</p>
<p>A teen who is diagnosed with a specific mental health condition such as <a title="Teen Depression Treatment in Utah - How To Help A Teenager With Suicidal Thoughts - Pathways Real Life Recovery" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/teen-depression-treatment-utah/">depression</a>, <a title="Anxiety in Teens Treatment in Utah - How To Help A Teenager With Suicidal Thoughts - Pathways Real Life Recovery" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/anxiety-teens-treatment-utah/">anxiety</a>, <a title="Utah Adolescent Drug Rehab - How To Help A Teenager With Suicidal Thoughts - Pathways Real Life Recovery" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/adolescent-treatment-utah/">substance abuse</a>, <a title="Teen Alcohol Treatment in Utah - How To Help A Teenager With Suicidal Thoughts - Pathways Real Life Recovery" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/teen-alcohol-treatment-utah/">alcohol addiction</a>, or schizophrenia may respond well to appropriate medication. For others, psychotherapy (talk therapy) may be indicated. This can involve <a title="Utah Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - How To Help A Teenager With Suicidal Thoughts - Pathways Real Life Recovery" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/">cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),</a> which aims to help individuals modify their behavior through a better understanding of their particular emotional triggers; or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), which has proved particularly effective for people with borderline personality disorder, proneness to mood swings and self-image issues.</p>
<p>It’s important to find a therapist and treatment center that both you and your teen are comfortable with and have confidence in. Any program should begin with a comprehensive assessment of the individual’s overall health and medical history, identifying any previous learning or behavioral problems, which may be relevant. A good therapist will also take into account the individual’s personal preferences regarding treatment while bearing in mind the seriousness of the threat of self-harm.</p>
<p>Therapy may be conducted either through one-to one sessions, group family meetings or a combination of both. Sessions will normally be conducted in the home or on an out-patient basis, but in rare, more extreme cases recovery residence care or even hospitalization may be indicated.</p>

As a child develops, it may get difficult for parents to know their feelings and thoughts. Adolescence has its high and low moments. However, a parent may not know when a <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/teen-depression-treatment-utah/">teen is depressed</a>. <em><strong>It&#8217;s essential to learn the possible factors that could cause severe depression to your kid that they <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/utah-suicide-prevention/">contemplate committing suicide</a></strong></em>.<br />
<strong>Here are some tips on how you could avert your child&#8217;s thoughts from suicide:</strong></p>
<h2><strong>1. Avoid Ignoring Suicide Threats</strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>Do not underestimate</strong></em> early suicidal signs. <em><strong><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/connections-between-mental-health-and-substance-abuse/">Teens may indulge in substance abuse</a> or merely isolate themselves</strong></em> from other family members. At times, the teenager issues <em><strong>verbal or written statements</strong></em> declaring their intentions to commit suicide. As a parent, you should <strong>take them seriously</strong>.</p>
<p>Often, kids mulling over suicide <em><strong>repeatedly inform</strong></em> their guardians and parents about it. Scientific studies reveal that such people <em><strong>don&#8217;t intend</strong></em> to kill themselves. Instead, the threats are usually a <strong>plea for urgent help and attention</strong>.</p>
<p>When your child starts issuing death threats, try to keep cool. Avoid displaying shock or scolding them. Spare some time to tentatively <em><strong>listen to your their concerns as you reassure them of your love and commitment</strong></em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-4819"></span></p>
<h2><strong>2. Consult a Certified Counselor</strong></h2>
<p>Promptly visit a pediatrician if your child&#8217;s strange behavior persists for a while. Alternatively, you can contact a nearby mental health specialist for her to evaluate your teen. He should start attending therapy sessions soon afterward if he is prone to self-harm.</p>
<p>You should also contact your psychological support team and mobilize it at a nearby emergency room. It&#8217;s essential to <em><strong>seek help right away</strong></em> if your kid is actively suicidal or if he intends to harm himself.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Control Your Child&#8217;s Anxiety</strong></h2>
<p>A child could have had a bad day. He should brighten up after a while. However, if his dampen spirit lasts for several days, you should get concerned. It&#8217;s proven that <em><strong>over 80% of American teens who commit suicide were once diagnosed with a mental disorder</strong></em>. <em>Most of them displayed intense anxiety and <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/teen-depression-treatment-utah/">depression</a>.</em></p>
<p>In most instances, depressed people become antisocial. However, they yearn to get <em><strong>rescued</strong></em> from their tabulations. They are <em><strong>often embarrassed</strong></em> to display their moodiness to loved ones. Its <em><strong>prevalent in boys</strong></em> as the society expects them to conceal their emotions.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Try to Figure Out Your Child&#8217;s Thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>Most teenagers who plan to commit suicide display strange actions and characters. Research has shown that in most families affected by teenage suicide have <em><strong>poor communications between parents and children</strong></em>.</p>
<p>However, other factors could lead to teen suicide. These include <em><strong>breakups, drug abuse, peer pressure, humiliation, impulsiveness and a severe medical condition</strong></em>. If your instinct cautions you that your kid wants to harm himself, take prudent measures. You need to learn how to <em><strong>communicate</strong></em> with and <em><strong>listen</strong></em> to your teen efficiently.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Express Your Feelings</strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>Assure your teen that you have their back</strong></em>. It&#8217;s normal for anyone to get anxious or depressed once in a while. It also happens in adults. <em><strong>Reassure them that tough times don&#8217;t last forever</strong></em> while avoiding aggravating their condition. It will encourage them to soldier on in life. They will eventually get through the depression after you enroll them in therapy sessions.</p>
<h2><strong>6. Discourage the Child from Isolating Himself</strong></h2>
<p>When facing a desperate situation in life, it isn&#8217;t wise to isolate yourself from other people. However, depressed teens tend to avoid being social. You should encourage your teen to have frequent walks in the neighborhood. It will help in <em><strong>distracting</strong></em> him from his troubles.</p>
<h2><strong>7. Remind Your Child to Be Patient</strong></h2>
<p>Talk therapies typically <em><strong>take time</strong></em> to improve an individual&#8217;s temperament. Your teen shouldn&#8217;t get discouraged in case his state doesn&#8217;t improve immediately. You should train him to be patient when expecting to see <em><strong>long-term life changes</strong></em>. Besides, he should strictly <em><strong>follow</strong></em> the therapy schedule without skipping any session.</p>
<h2><strong>8. Safely Store All Your Firearms</strong></h2>
<p>You should quickly store your weapons before your suicidal child picks it. A report from Brady Centre to Prevent Gun Violence reveals that in 2013, the number of American youth who committed suicide by firearms skyrocketed. It exceeded that of the previous 12 years. Most fatalities involved weapons <em><strong>possessed by a family member</strong></em>.</p>
<h2><strong>9. Urge Your Child Not To Pressurize Himself</strong></h2>
<p>Mental therapy takes time for its effects to be visible. Until he starts recuperating, avoid assigning numerous responsibilities to him. Urge him to <em><strong>divide complex tasks into smaller and manageable ones</strong></em>. He should also take part in <em><strong>leisure activities</strong></em>. The aim is to <em><strong>boost his confidence, self-esteem, and self-control</strong></em>.</p>
<h2><strong>10. Encourage Him to Work Out</strong></h2>
<p>Taking part in intense physical activities is essential. Working out <em><strong>stimulates the brain to produce endorphins</strong></em>. It&#8217;s a hormone that is said to <em><strong>enhance moods and relieving pain</strong></em>. Endorphins minimize the amount of cortisol circulating in the body. It is often associated with depression.<br />
A physical exercise distracts an individual from their challenges and enables them to have a higher self-appreciation. Physicians recommend work out sessions lasting up to thirty minutes a day. Your teen should work out three times a week for you to see significant improvement. However, you <em><strong>should select an activity that he enjoys</strong></em>.</p>

Often, this experimentation includes the use of drugs and/or other intoxicating substances. But the types of drugs and frequency of usage is changing for today’s college-aged teens. Let&#8217;s examine some trends in usage among this group.</p>
<p><span id="more-4564"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Up in Smoke</strong></h2>
<p>Cigarettes have been a ubiquitous rite of passage into adulthood for decades. Turning eighteen has signaled a change in expectations, rights, and freedoms with buying and smoking tobacco often playing a part in this ceremonial aging process. And it is no accident that tobacco companies heavily target this group in their ad campaigns. But now there is a new contender on the block, with marijuana becoming a more popular smoking substance than tobacco amongst college students. Of those polled through the University of <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/2/more-college-students-smoke-pot-daily-than-cigaret/" title="Higher education: More college students smoke pot daily than cigarettes">Michigan’s Institute for Social Research</a>, 5.9% of students said they smoked marijuana regularly,  and only 5.2% reporting smoking cigarettes as regularly. Be it a more high-profile topic in medical news and politics, a more relaxed approach from society or a combination of the two, marijuana usage seems to be on the rise. It should also be noted that cigarette usage has been on a decline amongst these same age groups for over a decade now. Even conceding this caveat, it is evidently clear marijuana is seeing a rise in popularity across the country.</p>
<h2><strong>Alcohol Use Going to Pot</strong></h2>
<p>As you can probably imagine,<a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/teen-alcohol-treatment-utah/" title="Teen Alcohol Treatment in Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery" > alcohol is still very popular amongst college-aged adults</a>. It’s availability and undeniable effects have helped to keep it a staple of many social gatherings and casual occasions. On an average day, 1.2 million college students will consume an alcoholic drink. Compared to roughly 700,000 students smoking pot per day, alcohol still has the bigger lead, <em><strong>but marijuana use is catching up.</strong></em> Some studies suggest that smoking marijuana, although mostly illegal in the U.S., is seen as less harmful or likely to lead to a hangover versus alcohol. Some students indicated that marijuana usage became their more popular choice as they grew older, as alcohol intoxication became less enjoyable. <em><strong>Overall, students choose alcohol more often, but this trend towards marijuana seems to be moving in much the same direction as that of cigarettes’ popularity. </strong></em></p>
<h2><strong>Pharmaceutical Drugs: A Prescription for Trouble</strong></h2>
<p>Possibly the most alarming aspect of <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/adolescent-treatment-utah/">teen drug</a> usage is the sharp rise in prescription drug abuse over recent years. Either through availability or perceived necessity, more and more undergrads are taking prescription drugs. And, not surprisingly, more and more college students are reporting problems with substance use or abuse of prescription pills. In fact, more teens are dying of prescription pill overdoses than heroin and cocaine combined. These are staggering numbers, which show no signs of change.</p>
<p>Although much of our focus has been on a particular segment of the population, these trends can be echoed in numerous other demographic groups. For example, prescription drug abuse has affected almost every subset of our population in some way. Communities across the nation have seen opiate overdoses on a steady incline and illegal drug sales, often to compensate for a lack of prescription availability, similarly following these rising numbers. Drug usage amongst teens, college bound or not, is always an indication of future societal problems, as teens struggling with use and addiction are statistically more likely to continue their usage into adulthood.</p>
<p>If you have a teen or even pre-teen, talk to them about these issues. <em><strong>Parents who have frank discussions with their children about drug use and addiction lessen the chances of their children falling into these traps by almost 42%</strong></em>. Unfortunately, only about 25% of college-aged teens report that they have had these conversations with their parents. If you or someone you know is struggling with addiction, seek treatment now, before it&#8217;s too late.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='Inward and Outward: How External Behavior and Addiction Are An Ongoing Cycle' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/inward-outward-external-behavior-addiction-ongoing-cycle/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><h2><strong>What Are Externalizing Behaviors?</strong></h2>
<p>Externalizing behaviors are directed outward, towards our environment and the people in it – everything from our jobs, to our friends and our families, to the person standing behind us in line at the coffee shop, or the clerk ringing up the sale. <em><strong>Instead of expressing negative emotion or anger in a productive way that addresses the problem directly, our reactions are directed at ‘innocent bystanders” in our immediate vicinity.</strong></em></p>
<p><span id="more-4413"></span></p>
<p>Some of these aggressive behaviors can run the gamut from irritability to verbal abuse or aggression, and can escalate to physical intimidation, bullying, and develop into dangerous or criminal action such as vandalism, theft, and assault.</p>
<h2>Externalizing Behaviors and Addiction</h2>
<p>Addictions can often develop from these patterns of behavior, usually as crutches or coping mechanisms for the individual. Saying <em><strong>“My boss is making life unbearable, so I need that drink,” is another way of justifying the behavior or actions and blaming other external elements.</strong> </em>Some of these addictive behaviors are drinking, drug use and gambling, and sexual activity or promiscuity, and the addict/externalizer will often do anything to remain unchanged and free of responsibility while compelling those around him or her to fit a certain comfort level.</p>
<p><strong>Externalizing Behavior Disorders</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) – <em>Subtype: Delinquent</em></span><br />
&#8211; Defiant, obstructive, argumentative behavior<br />
&#8211; Six months or more of continued non-compliant behavior pattern<br />
&#8211; Impairment of social, academic, or professional function</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conduct Disorder (CD) – <em>Subtype: Aggressive</em></span><br />
&#8211; Aggression and blatant violation of rules or directives<br />
&#8211; Aggression to people and animals/harm to same<br />
&#8211; Lying, theft, and patterns of deception<br />
&#8211; Serious violation of social rules and laws</p>
<h2>Adolescent Vulnerability – Why Children and Teens May Exhibit Externalizing Behavior</h2>
<p><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/parent-child-therapy/">Children</a> and <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/adolescent-treatment-utah/">Teenagers are particularly vulnerable</a> because of the natural shifts and changes in their biology and development.  Certain environmental, internal, or genetic factors can add to those stresses and result in <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/adult-teen-adolescent-behavioral-health-clinic-utah/">externalizing behaviors</a>. Some of these factors include physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, or loss of loved ones to death or removal from the environment. Physical and emotional trauma – domestic violence, instability, substance abuse – can also be huge elements in the development of aggressive or counterproductive behaviors.</p>
<p>There are internal factors singular to the individual, from mental illness or personality disorder to a learning disorder, physical trauma or physical disability, which can cause a gamut of stress and insecurity in a <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/benefits-parent-child-interaction-therapy">developing child’s brain and behaviors</a>. Children and teens may opt to keep their disability or disorder a secret, for fear of ridicule or being ostracized. Their externalized behaviors can then lead to expulsion from school – which is much more preferable than isolation from peers. Results can escalate to arrest or detainment by authorities, and carry greater risk of criminal patters and incarceration.</p>
<h2>Treatment for Children, Teens and Adults in Utah</h2>
<p>When presented with the need for treatment, the externalizer will also often rationalize the many reasons why they <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/changing-core-beliefs-emotional-reactions-behaviors/">engage in these patterns and why they need those behaviors to cope</a> – to insulate themselves against pain, sadness, intimidation or feelings of inadequacy, or to avoid confronting the root issue.  Sometimes the reasoning can be as simple for them as “I feel better when I drink, because it makes me feel happy”.  These rationales need to be identified head on, and the positive possibilities of treatment presented with equal clarity. Counseling, therapy, and sometimes medication are all options that can be discussed and reviewed, but it’s important that not only the individual receive help and intervention – it’s equally important for him or her to realize that a full, functional, and productive life is possible with the right tools, knowledge, and therapy.</p>
