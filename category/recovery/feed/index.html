<p>The practice of mindfulness originated in traditional Buddhist strategies of <em>training one’s own mind</em> to operate healthily and in greater harmony with one’s experience of existential reality. Over the generations, fostering the self-discipline of mindfulness has made its way into various Western therapies, due to its demonstrated physical and <a title="Practicing Mindfulness for Overcoming Obstacles to Substance Abuse Treatment" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/overcoming-obstacles-to-substance-abuse-treatment/">mental health benefits</a>.</p>



<h2 id="What-is">What is Mindfulness?</h2>



<p>Mindfulness is the simple yet challenging mental practice of <em>being aware</em> of your own thoughts in the moment and of your experiences of your world and your engagements with it — without judging them. It’s about <em>responding</em> instead of <em>reacting</em> to the occurrences that present themselves to you through the moments and days of your life. It involves a developed skill in tracking one’s mental activities, emotional feelings, and physical sensations.</p>



<p><em>Some important benefits of exercising mindfulness are:</em></p>

<h2 id="Misconceptions-of">Misconceptions of Mindfulness</h2>



<p>The point of practicing mindfulness is not to reach a <em>blank</em> mental state. On the contrary, it is about being <em>more </em>aware, more fully <em>present</em>. It is about sharpening one’s awareness of moments and thoughts and emotions and sensations. The point is to embrace awareness, not <em>expel</em> awareness from the mind. It is an exercise in curiosity about <em>all</em> that passes through the consciousness, and in freeing the mind from judgement about any of it.</p>



<p>Although <em>mindfulness</em> is a part of various forms of <em>meditation</em>, the two are not the <em>same</em> thing. Meditation is a dedicated activity, planned and executed, whereas mindfulness is best understood as a developed <em>way of thinking about your thoughts and experiences as they are occurring</em>. It’s a practice of observing and accepting one’s own perceptions of reality in everyday life.</p>



<h2 id="Why-Is-Mindfulness-Hard-to">Why Is Mindfulness Hard to Achieve?</h2>



<p>Today’s social and professional atmosphere can seem like immersion in a state of rapid and constant change. The persistent high energy and sense of perpetual rushing can cause a sense of disequilibrium, often leading to anxiety and even consequences of mental and emotional overload. The relentless daily exposure to it all can be a lot to manage <em>and</em> keep a sense of balance, peace, and contentment.</p>



<p>Self-therapeutic focus on building a richer and more objective awareness of one’s self and world (mindfulness), along with cultivating a mindset of <a title="The Neuroscience of Gratitude and How It Affects Anxiety and Grief" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/the-neuroscience-of-gratitude-and-how-it-affects-anxiety-and-grief/">gratitude</a> involves adopting <a title="Rewiring Your Brain to be Happier- Practicing Mindfulness" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/rewiring-your-brain-to-be-happier/">new ways of thinking</a>. Observing our thoughts and ways of processing our experiences require slowing down enough to experience the present more fully.</p>



<p>That can feel awkward for people who have recently come to practicing mindfulness. Like any other skill, it takes <em>practice</em> to master it, and every individual must try some techniques to discover which ones are most effective for him/her. Fortunately, it’s fun to do, so it’s soothing just to keep <em>trying</em> to exercise our own techniques for mindful self-observation.</p>



<p>Even better, there’s no possibility of failure while you’re <em>trying</em> to be mindful. In efforts at mindfulness, trying <em>is</em> succeeding. In other words, to <em>try</em> to focus on being mindful is what it is to <em>be</em> mindful in that moment.</p>



<h2 id="Mindfulness-for-Help-in-Trauma">Mindfulness for Help in Trauma Recovery</h2>



<p>Moving through life at high speed is a manner of coping for many people struggling with the <a title="Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment in Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd-treatment-in-utah/">effects of past trauma</a>. Practicing mindfulness offers an important tool for helping overcome the often long-lasting effects of trauma. Each person can choose a level of practice to imbue daily consciousness with greater mindfulness.</p>



<p>In making the effort toward more mindful living, each person can be anticipated to find and enjoy his/her <em>own</em> level and comfortable pace of the practice. It can be as easy as closing your eyes and or just sitting quietly and intentionally <em>listening to your own thoughts and feelings</em>, without judging them as they flow through you.</p>



<p>Being mindful is being fully <em>present</em> in your environment, being fully <em>aware</em> of your mental, emotional, and physical responses to it, and discovering that you are feeling comfortable with yourself.</p>



<h2 id="Mindfulness-for-Help-in-Relapse">Mindfulness for Help in Relapse Prevention</h2>



<p>Practicing powerful techniques for developing a habit of mindfulness can help people suffering from substance abuse disorder, anxiety, <a title="Treat Severe Depression- Mindfulness is One of The Key" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/its-time-to-change-the-way-we-view-and-treat-severe-depression/">depression</a>, and other <a title="Mental Health Services We Provide at Pathways" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/mental-health-services/">mental health issues</a>.</p>



<p>One vast value of mindfulness is its effectiveness in a person’s efforts toward training his or her own mind to navigate through challenging thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations without reacting to them by practicing unhealthy or even self-destructive behaviors.</p>



<p>An extraordinarily beneficial effect of training one’s own mind to sustain a state of increased mindfulness is a greater ability to detect initial <a title="Mindfulness-Based Drug &amp; Alcohol Relapse Prevention (MBRP)" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/relapse-prevention-utah/">signs of relapse</a> risk by observing your own thoughts, emotions, and physical experience.</p>



<p><em>Practicing</em> <em>awareness</em> of what you are experiencing in these ways can empower you to recognize and respond to early signs of oncoming internal derailing that has led to substance abuse in the past. <em>Using</em> your mindfulness this way can be very powerful in helping sustain addiction recovery. It also enables us to show <em>self-compassion</em> even if relapse occurs. It further helps a person more adeptly bring himself or herself back out of substance abuse <em>sooner</em>, and with even better-developed tools for more lasting success in sobriety going forward.</p>



<h2 id="How-Can-I-Practice">How Can I Practice Mindfulness?</h2>



<p>Practicing mindfulness is a very simple matter of quieting the mind and paying attention to your thoughts as they flow into and out of your mind. It’s just observing your thoughts as they come and go. This is what it is to just <em>be present</em>, also known as to <em>live in the moment</em>. It’s a way to inner balance and greater happiness.</p>



<p>Of course, being <em>simple</em> doesn’t mean it’s <em>easy</em>. It does take practice to eventually find oneself more automatically maintaining an ongoing state of mindfulness. So, practice for a few minutes each day, until you find it becoming a more frequent habit. Strengthen your newly developing habit by continuing to practice it <em>intentionally</em> during times when you find you have drifted out of the mindset.</p>



<p>Continue this process until you find yourself eventually living more continuously in a mindful state. But, mindfulness is naturally an <em>endeavor</em> — with progress for those who continue the practice — not a permanent accomplishment. Take comfort in that fact as you embark on an ever-aspiring life-long journey of gently coaxing your mind into greater extents of mindful awareness.</p>



<h2 id="External-Aids-for-Cultivating">External Aids for Cultivating Mindfulness</h2>



<p>Practicing mindfulness can be challenging in our busy lives and fast-paced environment, but we have the benefit of a great wealth of <a title="Contact Our Experts to Know the Benefits of Mindfulness" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/">resources for cultivating mindfulness</a>. If it helps, you might try attending organized mindfulness group sessions. There are also abundant group meditation opportunities. Or, just walk, sit, lie down, bike, or do something else that helps you free your consciousness to use the activity for focusing your awareness on all the thoughts and sensations you experience while engaged in it.</p>



<p>Modern technologies offer additional resources for developing mindfulness. For example, you can watch online instructional videos and podcasts offering mindfulness guidance. There are even free apps to aid in meditation, and others for developing and practicing mindfulness.</p>

It&#8217;s true. Psychologists at the University of California at Davis and the University of Miami published a paper in 2003 to examine what happens to our bodies when we practice gratitude. The results might surprise you!</p>
<p><span id="more-5790"></span></p>
<h2>The Study About the Neuroscience of Gratitude</h2>
<p><i>The study went like this:</i> subjects in the study were asked to keep a daily journal of the day&#8217;s events. One-third of the subjects were asked to focus on events that made them feel grateful, one-third of subjects were asked to focus on events that had upset them, and one-third of subjects were asked to record information that was neither positive nor negative.</p>
<p><i>Here’s what they discovered:</i> people who spent time examining events that had made them happy were overall happier and healthier than people who didn&#8217;t. People who recorded positive events in their daily journals were more active than people who had not, and went to the doctor fewer times than people who had recorded either negative experiences or neutral experiences in their journals. Overall, people who recorded positive events in their lives also had a more optimistic view of recent events.</p>
<p>Other effects of gratitude include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Reduced feelings of anxiety</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Fewer instances of depression</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Better sleep quality</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Less fatigue</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Reduced inflammation</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Reduced risk of heart failure</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Does Gratitude Positively Impact Your Body?</h2>
<p>Gratitude positively impacts your body by activating the parts of the brain associated with social cognition, moral cognition, value judgment, and reward. In other words, gratitude makes you more supportive of others, and more empathetic.</p>
<p>It also affects metabolism, body temperature, appetite, and sleep. Feelings of gratitude are accompanied by dopamine, which is the hormone associated with pleasure. In some cases, people who practice gratitude are less likely to experience suicidal feelings.</p>
<h2>What Can You Do To Become More Grateful?</h2>
<p>Knowing that feelings of gratitude are good for you, here&#8217;s what you can do to practice gratitude actively in your life.</p>
<h3>Keep a Journal</h3>
<p>Just as those people in that study benefited from writing down their positive experiences, you can too. Keep a journal of positive experiences to make it easier to examine your feelings of gratitude for positive things that have happened throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Reflect When Something Positive Happens</h3>
<p>Think about it when you notice yourself having a happy feeling. Ask yourself why this is something that you are grateful for, and what you might be able to do to repeat the experience.</p>
<h3>Tell Others When Something Good Happens</h3>
<p>When something positive happens to you, tell others about your experience. This makes it easier to remember the good things that have happened to you throughout the day.</p>

But for many people, this time can bring or worsen anxiety, depression, and stress. This can be caused by many factors which may include increased financial burden as a result of travel, gifts and hotel charges. You may also be overwhelmed since the holiday season includes lots of parties, traveling, and performances which are difficult to balance with everyday self-care and responsibilities. </span><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Pathways Real Life Recovery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> offers mental health counseling services in Sandy, Utah. </span><b><i>If you experience one of the above challenges, the following are tips that you can use to manage your increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression during your holiday</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-5077"></span></p>
<h2>1. Improve Your Physical Health</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can introduce some form of regular exercise during the holiday. </span><b><i>Exercise strengthens the lungs and heart and also releases dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and endorphins that have an energizing effect and lift our mood</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. The effects of exercise are felt instantly, unlike medication which can take several weeks to kick in. Exercise also contributes to a more positive body image, which can be helpful for those wishing to increase their self-esteem and self-confidence.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>2. Build Your Resilience</strong><br />
</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You should build your emotional resilience to cope with ups and downs during a holiday. </span><b><i>Resilience is our ability to maintain or recover good feeling about ourselves, independent of the environment we may find ourselves in</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Emotional resilience can be achieved in many ways, but the most crucial is by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Talking to someone,</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> e.g., to a friend, family member or a counselor, because communication releases tension that may build up inside.</span></li>
<li><b>Improving your self-esteem &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> this is particularly important since many situations in our lives, such as relationship break-ups, not getting the job we want, can dramatically lower our self-esteem. People wishing to improve their self-esteem must treat themselves in a positive but honest way.</span></li>
<li><b>Managing your stress levels &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> reduce your working hours, ask for help, get some regular &#8216;me-time&#8217; when you can completely relax and unwind by developing good relationships with your friends, family or your partner.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Take Care of Yourself</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Paying attention to your own feeling and needs is essential. </span><b><i>You must try to achieve a balance between what you enjoy and your daily responsibilities, in order to prevent a build-up of stress and negative emotions</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Consider learning and discovering new things. Research has proved that by simply walking a small distance when on holiday can reduce stress and blood pressure naturally. Finally, </span><b><i>avoid drugs and alcohol to cope</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Even though escaping may sound appealing, drugs and alcohol actually worsen symptoms. </span><b><i>Choosing a well-balanced diet and drinking water over alcohol is guaranteed that you will feel much better, both physically and emotionally</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>

While gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer and trans identity individuals are finding increased mainstream support and acceptance, as many as 65% commonly face anti-LGBTQ harassment and discrimination.</p>
<p><span id="more-5065"></span></p>
<p><strong><em>The effects of discrimination contribute to an alarmingly high rate of <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/drug-rehab-sandy-utah/">substance abuse</a>, <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/depression-treatment-utah/">depression</a>, and <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/utah-suicide-prevention/">suicide</a> among LGBTQ individuals.</em></strong> A staggering 40% of those who identify as transgender has reported attempting suicide. But as shocking as these statistics are, the future is becoming less bleak every day. <strong><em>Emerging mental health resources for LGBTQ people are becoming more attainable thanks to the tireless work of LGBTQ activists and increasing support of allies</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Your active support is critical for the mental wellness of your LGBTQ loved one. <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/"><strong>Pathways Real Life Recovery Center in Utah</strong></a> understands that<strong><em> acceptance from loved ones and active family support play a particularly important role to prevent suicide</em></strong>. Be a part of the solution and lend your support by becoming an LGBTQ ally. Here are 5 ways to support the <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/lgbtq-counselor-in-utah/">mental health of your LGBTQ loved ones</a>:</p>
<h2><strong>1. Stand Up for Your Loved One!</strong></h2>
<p>Becoming a true ally can make a big difference in the daily life of your LGBTQ loved one. Life is challenging for all of us, but LGBTQ people often face anti-LGBTQ words and actions that create difficult barriers even in seemingly simple circumstances. As allies, it is our job to <strong><em>stand up for our LGBTQ loved ones by calling out anti-LGBTQ behavior</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Educate other family members about acceptance by explaining LGBTQ identities and openly answering questions. Show your support at work by having your LGBTQ co-worker&#8217;s back and always call out discrimination. You can also <strong><em>make a difference by advocating for company or policy changes that will encourage acceptance and understanding</em></strong> like diversity training.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Respect Their Chosen Identity</strong></h2>
<p>Affirm the love and support for the LGBTQ people in your life by respecting how they choose to live their lives, who they choose to love and how they choose to be identified. <strong><em>Embrace their individual self-expression and stay away from pressuring them to conform.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Always use an individual&#8217;s personally chosen gender pronouns and encourage or correct others to do the same.</em></strong> Research shows that the risk of suicide is reduced for transgender youth whose communities affirm their chosen identities.</p>
<h2><strong>3. NEVER &#8216;Out&#8217; Your LGBTQ Loved One</strong></h2>
<p>Coming out isn&#8217;t just revealing sexual orientation or gender identity. For most people, coming out is a long and difficult process. Each individual will face different life circumstances that greatly influence their coming out experience. <strong><em>Another person should never assume that they understand the contributing factors of such a challenging and life-changing moment.</em></strong></p>
<p>While there is nothing shameful about being LGBTQ, openly expressing it &#8211; or not &#8211; is a highly personal choice. An individual has the right to facilitate their own terms about their identity and how open they wish to be, even if that differs greatly from one situation to the next. <strong><em>Make sure your LGBTQ loved one knows that you support their choices of expression and how they choose to share them.</em></strong></p>
<h2><strong>4. Confront Your Own Biases</strong></h2>
<p>You love and support your LGBTQ family and friends. But whether you are aware of it or not, <strong><em>we all have involuntary implicit biases that can cause us to react in a discriminatory manner</em></strong>. This unconscious discrimination has deep-seated influences that no one is immune to like gender, religion, and class.</p>
<p>While it is okay to make mistakes, it is important to acknowledge and confront implicit biases in ourselves in order to better support our LGBTQ loved ones. <strong><em>Recognizing our own assumptions about gender, family, love, sex, and intimacy will help us confront biases that normally would never even surface. </em></strong></p>
<p>Work on yourself to <strong><em>adjust the way you unconsciously think and feel to match your current level of love and understanding</em></strong> to be your LGBTQ loved one&#8217;s best ally!</p>
<h2><strong>5. Support and Help Them Access Mental Health Resources</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Support the mental health of your LGBTQ loved ones by being a good listener and making sure they know that you are there for them.</em></strong> You can help them find local resources for <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/our-services/">therapy and substance abuse treatment</a>, an <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/lgbtq-counselor-in-utah/">LGBTQ-friendly therapist</a> and make sure they know about the <strong><a href="https://www.glbthotline.org/national-hotline.html">LGBTQ National Help Center hotline</a>, 1-888-843-4564 </strong>to instantly connect with someone who cares.</p>

We’ve gathered a collection of inspiring addiction recovery quotes to help those on the path to recovery.<br />
<span id="more-4610"></span></p>
<h2>May the Bridges I Burn Light the Way</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4613" title="1st - Most Inspirational Recovery Quote - Pathways Real Life Recovery, Utah" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/1-1.png" alt="May the Bridges I Burn Light the Way" width="600" height="315" srcset="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/1-1.png 1200w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/1-1-300x157.png 300w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/1-1-768x402.png 768w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/1-1-1024x536.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>People who recover from addiction have consciously resolved to leave some people and places in the rear-view mirror. It’s OK—necessary—to disengage from people who aren’t supporting our recovery.</p>
<p>Yet we need to examine those former paths of ours. They can teach us to avoid similar situations—to make better future decisions.</p>
<h2>You Can’t Change What’s Going on Around You Until You Start Changing What’s Going On Within You</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4617" title="2nd - Most Inspirational Recovery Quote - Pathways Real Life Recovery, Utah" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2-1.png" alt="You Can’t Change What’s Going on Around You Until You Start Changing What’s Going On Within You" width="600" height="315" srcset="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2-1.png 1200w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2-1-300x157.png 300w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2-1-768x402.png 768w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2-1-1024x536.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>When things keep going wrong, it’s hard to resist anger at other people. But recovery starts in wanting major changes within the self. We want to get better.</p>
<h2>You Have to Get Up Every Morning and Tell Yourself “I Can Do This.”</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4616" title="3rd - Most Inspirational Recovery Quote - Pathways Real Life Recovery, Utah" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/3.png" alt="You Have to Get Up Every Morning and Tell Yourself “I Can Do This.”" width="600" height="315" srcset="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/3.png 1200w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/3-300x157.png 300w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/3-768x402.png 768w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/3-1024x536.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>What’s the language of that voice in our head? If it’s “It can’t work” or “I’m going to fail at this” then it’s time to re-train the brain. Change your inner voice into your coach, drumming into you powerful self-belief, transforming your life’s interactions.</p>
<h2>At the Root of All Addiction is Pain</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4612" title="4th - Most Inspirational Recovery Quote - Pathways Real Life Recovery, Utah" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/6.png" alt="At the Root of All Addiction is Pain" width="600" height="315" srcset="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/6.png 1200w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/6-300x157.png 300w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/6-768x402.png 768w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/6-1024x536.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Shame and loneliness are painful to human beings, and are the top triggers for relapse. In contrast, love, connection, and communication can heal. So we focus on healing the shame, working on deep self-worth, accountability, and connections with others.</p>
<h2>A Trigger is a Connection Between the Conscious Mind and a Buried Painful Memory</h2>
<p>Effective treatment identifies our triggers and enables us to overcome them. Conscious knowledge of where that mental pain came from, and how it shapes our reactions, allows us to make our own decisions about how to respond.</p>
<p>Imagine how we can change our lives if we could free ourselves from traps set up by the past, and take the lead our decisions.</p>
<h2>It Won’t Be Like This Forever</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4614" title="5th - Most Inspirational Recovery Quote - Pathways Real Life Recovery, Utah" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/5.png" alt="A Trigger is a Connection Between the Conscious Mind and a Buried Painful Memory" width="600" height="315" srcset="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/5.png 1200w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/5-300x157.png 300w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/5-768x402.png 768w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/5-1024x536.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Addiction makes a person feel hopeless and trapped. But heal the underlying cause that drives us to use, and yes: It is possible to end an addiction.</p>
<p>Yes, a person can become entrenched in a cycle. It’s not helpful to be shamed for a habitual behavior and state of mind which becomes a trap. But people can change their minds and behavior. To say one is doomed is an illusion.</p>
<h2>One of the Hardest Things Was Learning I was Worth Recovery</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4615" title="6th - Most Inspirational Recovery Quote - Pathways Real Life Recovery, Utah" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/4.png" alt="It Won’t Be Like This Forever " width="600" height="315" srcset="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/4.png 1200w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/4-300x157.png 300w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/4-768x402.png 768w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/4-1024x536.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Addiction leads to embarrassing actions that are out of character. Everyone is worth recovery. At Pathways, we know it&#8217;s essentially about loving ourselves. Sometimes it’s the hardest thing to learn. Pathways can bring you to your real solution.</p>
<h2>Sobriety Looks Good on You</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4611" title="7th - Most Inspirational Recovery Quote - Pathways Real Life Recovery, Utah" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/7.png" alt="One of the Hardest Things Was Learning I was Worth Recovery" width="600" height="315" srcset="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/7.png 1200w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/7-300x157.png 300w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/7-768x402.png 768w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/7-1024x536.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Dealing with our issues makes us admirable—to ourselves and to others. We become the kind of folks others look up to.</p>
<p>Our tailor-made, intensive outpatient program addresses any kind of destructive issues: marital, personal, disorders, pornography, and more. We break the cycle of guilt and shame, helping clients accept where they are in order to make life changes. We treat our clients with love, dignity, and respect.</p>

But with a little discipline, a strong commitment and support from within yourself and people you trust, you can get through this stressful period sober.</p>
<p><span id="more-4514"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Commit Before the Event </strong></h2>
<p>Use your personal energy and strength before the party to reinforce your commitment to sobriety. Whether it’s through meditation, prayer, or a personal affirmation, remind yourself that the gathering is just a tiny blip in time.</p>
<p>Prepare responses ahead of time for avoiding drinking or using behavior by saying you’re the designated driver or you have an early morning commitment and need to be fresh and alert first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>Look for healthy alternatives. Most holiday parties feature a wide selection of food and treats. Give yourself permission to indulge at the buffet table instead of the bar. Sample those that look intriguing, and focus on how delicious the food as a way to redirect an otherwise uncomfortable conversation.</p>
<h2><strong>Stick to Priorities</strong></h2>
<p>Don’t let the pressures of the celebrations and parties around the holidays influence your behavior. The time you spend at those and their value to you are small compared to living well for the rest of your life. Your physical, mental and spiritual health are more important than anything else you have. Spend enough time with friends and family who support you because they’re the ones who mean the most.</p>
<h2><strong>Stay Healthy</strong></h2>
<p>Go for the safe indulgences, but remember it’s important to maintain healthy eating habits throughout the holidays. What you eat does affect your mind and body. <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/benefits-journaling-addiction-recovery/">Use a journal to express thoughts and feelings</a> if you that writing them down helps you. Try not to let too many holiday activities interrupt your exercise schedule. It’s just as important as food for maintaining a good attitude, especially during stressful periods. If you are short on time, do small things like parking further away and walking or using the stairs instead of the elevator. Anything you can do to raise your endorphins will increase your sense of well-being and promote your overall health.</p>
<h2><strong>Say No Sometimes</strong></h2>
<p>No one knows better than you do how much socializing you enjoy, and don’t be afraid to turn invitations down when your enthusiasm wanes. It’s better to beg off from something that will stress you out, rather than go and be uncomfortable. If you must make an appearance, bring along a supportive friend or family member whom you trust. It may change your attitude from dread to pleasant anticipation.</p>
<h2><strong>Change It up This Year</strong></h2>
<p>Instead of relying on all the traditions you’ve inherited and the memories they carry, start some new ones. Hold some brainstorming sessions around the kitchen table about new things you can do to celebrate or acknowledge the meaning of holidays for you. Acknowledge the resistance some friends or family members may have about leaving some things behind and trying what’s new. Being honest about why you need something new this year in a positive way.</p>
<h2><strong>Share Something of Yourself</strong></h2>
<p>Substitute party time or some of your downtime with others who need help. The demand for volunteers at local organizations is always high and much needed. Single out the talents you have, your key interests, and how much time you have to share. And don’t rule out the spontaneous act of giving. The personal rewards from making life better for someone else are enormous.</p>
<h2><strong>Give Yourself Kudos</strong></h2>
<p>As the days go by during the holiday season, acknowledge that your commitment to abstain takes courage. The more you exercise your strength to maintain sobriety, the more it will increase, making you a stronger and healthier person.</p>

If you have a family member or friend that has Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), and you’ve decided to help them, here are some tips that can help.</p>
<h2><strong>Learn About Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) </strong></h2>
<p>The best thing you can do is<em><strong> arm yourself with information about Borderline Personality Disorder.</strong></em> Instead of getting into a yelling match, you can find solutions by learning how to speak to them. Understanding the symptoms and how to respond to those with Borderline Personality Disorder can make the experience of engagement a productive one.</p>
<p><span id="more-4474"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Rules for Engagement</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to dealing with a person with Borderline Personality Disorder it is important to learn how to engage. The most important things to remember are- you didn’t cause this person to behave this way, you can’t cure this disease, and you most certainly can’t control the outbursts. During this type of engagement, it is <em><strong>best to simplify your statements</strong></em>. Remember emotion is likely to be so strong, so <em><strong>make each sentence short, simple, and direct. Leave no room for misinterpretation</strong></em>. By remembering these things, you can keep a level head.</p>
<p>You can also practice a method called Delay, Distract, Depersonalize, and Detach.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Delay</strong>: Delay engaging in an outburst with a Borderline Personality Disorder, with a calm voice, and by telling them to give you more time to think about what they are saying.</li>
<li><strong>Distract:</strong> Try suggesting the two of you do something else like run errands or go out.</li>
<li><strong>Depersonalize:</strong> What they are saying is not real and you should not allow yourself to feel the sting of their words. It’s just another outburst.</li>
<li><strong>Detach:</strong> Refuse to allow yourself to caught up in an emotional response to their words during an outburst.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Support Yourself</strong></h2>
<p>When a situation becomes too hectic or chaotic and you are finding it difficult to disengage, it is best to leave in order to take care of yourself and deal with your own feelings. Seek counseling for yourself if necessary, or join a support group. There are therapists in your area that deal specifically with Borderline Personality Disorder and their family members or can point you in the direction of a group therapy session.</p>
<h2><strong>Never Ignore Comments about Suicide</strong></h2>
<p>If someone with Borderline Personality Disorder is threatening to take their own life, harm themselves or bring harm to someone else, immediately call your local <a href="http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/gethelp/lifelinechat.aspx">suicide support line</a> at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or 911. Under no circumstances should you leave this person alone.</p>
<h2><strong>Seek Treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) from a Licensed Therapist in Utah</strong></h2>
<p>If you feel that the situation has exhausted you and other family members, you should seek professional help from a licensed therapist that specifically specializes in treating Borderline Personality Disorder patients. <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/borderline-personality-disorder-treatment/">Pathways Real Life Recovery offers Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) treatment in Utah</a>.

Being an introvert can come with some challenges, particularly during the summer months.</p>
<p><span id="more-4466"></span></p>
<h2><strong>What is an Introvert?</strong></h2>
<p>Since introverts are often misunderstood, <strong><em>here’s a look at the common characteristics of an introvert:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy time alone</li>
<li>Do their best thinking alone</li>
<li>Avoid upset or angry people</li>
<li>Have small groups of close friends</li>
<li>Don’t initiate small talk</li>
<li>Make excellent self-starters</li>
<li>Are fine letting others take the limelight</li>
<li>May not reach out to others voluntarily</li>
<li>Are often described as quiet</li>
<li>May find too much stimulation leaves them unfocused and distracted</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>7 Struggles Introverts Face During the Summer</strong></h2>
<p>Introverts face unique challenges throughout the year, but <strong><em>the summer brings along some unique struggles,</em></strong> including:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Difficultly reenergizing after big summer shindigs</strong> – When summer parties turn into big events with a lot of people, it’s often difficult to reenergize and get your balance back if you attend one of these shindigs.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding the beach because of the crowd</strong> – The beach is the place to be during the hot summer months, but introverts often miss out because they avoid crowded beaches where they feel overwhelmed by people.</li>
<li><strong>Binge-watching shows sounds better than going out</strong> – Summer often seems like a great time to stay at home binge-watching new or favorite television shows instead of getting up enough energy to go out.</li>
<li><strong>When you do want to go out, it’s tough to start the conversation</strong> – Of course, introverts occasionally do want to go out, but it’s often tough to start the conversation with friends about a night out together. You may simply avoid going out because you don’t want to start the conversation to make plans.</li>
<li><strong>Worrying your small group of friends is getting tired of you</strong> – You probably have a small group of friends you hang out with in the summer, but you may worry that they are getting tired of you, which may lead you to cancel plans.</li>
<li><strong>Making plans, then cancelling at the last minute</strong> – Sometimes plans to go out sound great, until the day it’s time to head out. You may find yourself bailing at the last minute because you don’t feel like you have the energy to deal with people.</li>
<li><strong>Never getting a tan because you stay indoors all summer</strong> – Instead of heading out for a healthy dose of vitamin D, you may find that you constantly stay indoors throughout the summer.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Overcoming Your Struggles</strong></h2>
<p>Being an introvert isn’t a bad thing, but if you find that it’s leaving you struggling this summer, <strong><em>you can find ways to overcome those struggles.</em></strong> <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pathways Real Life Recovery</a> offers excellent services that can help you learn to branch out more as an introvert.

<p>A way of “letting go,” jotting down your feelings is an important part of your <a href="http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/addiction" title="The Benefits of an Addiction Recovery Journal" alt="Pathways Real Life Recovery - Addiction definition" target="blank" >addiction</a> recovery. Whether you are dependent on a substance or a behavior, <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/why-pathways/" title="Why Choose Pathways Real Life Recovery - Recovery Journal Utah" alt="Pathways Real Life Recovery - Why should I choose Pathways?">Pathway Real Life Recovery </a>is here to help bring order into your life by assisting you in your battle against addiction. There are irreplaceable tools in any battle, recovery journaling is a tool that plays an important role in restoring good mental and physical health free of chaos.</p>
<p><span id="more-4455"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Benefits of Keeping a Recovery Journal</strong></h2>
<p>One of the benefits of keeping a recovery journal is the lasting impact it will have on your life. It puts your memories from the past behind you to rest peacefully and encourages your goals and dreams of the future to come forth clearly in front of you. <em><strong>Studies have shown that writing down your thoughts when you are in <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/category/recovery/" alt="The path to recovery" title="Pathways Real Life Recovery - Posts under the Recovery category" title="Pathways Real Life Recovery - Recovery category from the Pathways Real life Blog">recovery</a> helps bring your mind, body, and spirit back </strong></em>in<em><strong> harmony.</strong> </em>Journaling empowers you with the strength you need to overcome your <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/our-services/" alt="Pathways Real Life Recovery - Our Services" title="Pathways Real Life Recovery - Our Recovery &#038; Individual Treatment Services">addiction</a> and lead a happy, healthy addiction free life.</p>
<p>Be certain to write in your journal every day. Taking 20 or 30 minutes out of your day is a small amount of time that makes a large significant difference in your recovery. Writing down your feelings will lift that huge burden off your shoulders one piece at a time, one entry at a time, until every piece falls back into perfect place. Journaling helps make the “roller coaster ride” of emotions significantly smoother.</p>
<p>Pathways Real Life Recovery embraces journaling with open arms. Hand in hand, heart to heart, we help heal lives one page at a time.</p>
<h2><strong>Types of Recovery Journals</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4457" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/1-300x200.jpg" alt="Addiction Recovery Journal Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery" title="Addiction Recovery Journal Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/1-360x240.jpg 360w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/1.jpg 473w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />There are several different types of journals:</p>
<p><strong><em>A Stream of Consciousness Journal</em></strong> &#8211; To avoid restriction of the format of your writing, stream-of-consciousness journaling is better done with pen and paper than using a computer. When writing, chose a spot that is comfortable and free of distractions. Write down your emotions or feelings regarding an event, past or present. Whether it sounds silly, crazy, or weird, just keep writing until you run out of words.</p>
<p><strong><em>Diary Journal</em></strong> &#8211; A diary journal is generally used to record daily events. This type of journal helps you to recognize the daily events that may have triggered the negative thoughts bringing the addiction into your life.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gratitude Journal </em></strong>&#8211; Focusing your thoughts on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal" title="Gratitude journal, Pathways Real Life Recovery - Recovery Journal Utah" title="Pathways Real Life Recovery - Gratitude Journal definition" >positive</a> events of your life are recorded in a gratitude journal. Expressing your thankful feelings can bring happiness and joy into “full circle” for you.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spiritual Journal</em></strong> &#8211; Keeping a <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Keep-a-Spiritual-Journal" title="How to Keep a Spiritual Journal. Pathways Real Life Recovery - Recovery Journal Utah" alt="Keep a Spiritual Journal by Wikihow.com - Pathways Real Life Recovery - Recovery Journal Utah" target="_blank">spiritual</a> journal is a conscious way to keep track of your spiritual growth. Keep your journal with you, there is never a specific time of day or night when a spiritually moving experience might occur.</p>
<p><strong><em>Health Journal</em></strong> &#8211; a <a href="http://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/healthcare-management/working-with-your-doctor/creating-a-health-journal.html" title="FamilyDoctor.org Creating a Health Journal - Pathways Real Life Recovery">health</a> journal helps keep track of every aspect of your health.</p>
<h2><strong>Steps to Start a Recovery Journal</strong></h2>
<p>Choose a writing journal that reflects who you are. Getting a journal with your favorite color or material will inspire you to open it up, and start writing. Whether it’s red or blue, bound in leather or even an online app, let it become your BFF. No one is going to be judging you in your journal. <em><strong>Keep your entries honest,</strong></em> openly spill out your thoughts. In this way, you are confronting your addiction and the emotions that go along with it.</p>
<p>When you bring positive changes to what’s going on inside you, you can change the way you behave. <em><strong>Journaling brings attention to the situations and conditions where you are likely to give in to your addiction</strong></em>. To prevent tripping in the future, you need to remove the habits from the past that made you fall. Through journaling and other activities, such as meditation or getting back to nature, you old habits can disappear. Your life will take a new direction through recovery. The chaos that comes with addiction will be replaced with a positive organization.</p>

How do you prevent relapse once treatment ends?</strong> </em>Learn about relapse, the causes of relapse, triggers that potentially lead to relapse and<a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/relapse-prevention-utah/"> relapse prevention</a> as part of the ongoing recovery process.</p>
<h2><strong>Relapse Prevention Tips</strong></h2>
<p>Getting clean and sober does not mean you become a dull, boring person. It simply means you have fun without that drink in your hand or needle in your arm. As you become healthier, you realize how much better you actually feel.  Consider these tips to help you stay clean:</p>
<p><span id="more-4441"></span></p>
<h3><strong><em>Establish a support network</em></strong></h3>
<p>Establishing a support network of people who support you in your recovery provides the positive influences you need. <strong><em>Ask sober friends if you can call them at any time</em></strong>. Your using did not occur from 9 to 5 and your weak moments will almost certainly not occur on a 9 to 5 schedule. Once you have received the go-ahead from this network, use it.  Do not hesitate to contact someone because it might not be a “reasonable” hour, or you are worried you will pull them away from something important.  If they have discussed your possible need for an emergency support system, trust that they meant it when they told you to call them at “any time, day or night.”  In that moment of crisis, you are more important to them than anything else they may be doing.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Avoid old people, old places, and old things</em></strong></h3>
<p>You cannot put yourself in places or situations where you have the opportunity or desire to use again. It is easy for the addict to assume that a relapse will not occur. When you go around people you used to drink and drug with, those old “friends” will likely urge you to “Have one for old times’ sake” or tell you that “One drink will not hurt you.” Perhaps you think you can go into the club and drink a non-alcoholic beverage. Not likely and you know it.<strong><em> Avoid the toxic places and people that have the potential to lead you to a relapse</em></strong>. Find new opportunities to socialize, whether it means joining a gym, attending dance classes, joining a club or organization or spending time with someone who enjoys the same safe hobbies that you enjoy.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Keep all aftercare appointments and meetings</em></strong></h3>
<p>After you complete a treatment program aftercare becomes crucial to your ongoing recovery. Aftercare provides you with ongoing tools and support to sustain your sobriety. Living your new life, free of alcohol and drugs is a new way of life. You need the ongoing aftercare to strengthen your self-esteem and willpower and to provide you with a support network.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Take your medications</em></strong></h3>
<p>Medications are an important part of treatment and ongoing aftercare for many people. If you take medications, taking the medicine as prescribed provides you with the best opportunity for the medications to work and for you to retain a sustained dose of the medications in your body. NIDA points out that medications help manage withdrawal symptoms as well as to prevent relapse and manage other conditions such as co-occurring disorders.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Create a healthy schedule</em></strong></h3>
<p>Creating a schedule after rehab is a great way to develop a new and healthy routine. Make time for treatment, journaling, and relaxation. Too much idle time on your hands presents potential opportunities for weak moments. Keep yourself busy and keep a schedule to stay on track. When you keep a schedule of planned recreational or social activities as well as a schedule of aftercare appointments and meetings, you minimize your idle time.</p>
<h3><strong>Don’t View Relapse as a Failure</strong></h3>
<p><em><strong>Just because you relapse does not mean that your treatment failed. It does indicate, however, that you need adjustments to your recovery</strong></em>. Some people do not enter an actual treatment program, choosing instead to simply rely on Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Narcotics Anonymous (NA) or another type of 12-step program. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remember, these programs are support groups; they are not actual substance abuse treatment programs.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>Entering into an actual treatment program gives you the tools you need to increase your chances of remaining clean and sober</strong></em>. Another misconception is that <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/detox-center-utah/">detox</a> is treatment. Detox is not treatment. It is a means of quickly cleansing your system of the toxic alcohol or other drugs to stabilize you. Remember that even after completing a comprehensive treatment program, relapse is still a possibility.<em><strong> Options for <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/genetic-testing/">relapse prevention includes adjustments such as increasing medication,</a> increasing aftercare sessions, re-entering treatment, moving into a sober living home or other options deemed appropriate for you.</strong></em></p>
<h3><strong>Avoiding Relapse Starts with Tailored Addiction Recovery Treatment</strong></h3>
<p><em><strong>Your recovery begins when you decide to make the call to start treatment. There is no one-size-fits-all treatment plan for all addicts. Each person entering into treatment needs to have an individual treatment plan tailored to his or her treatment needs.</strong></em> Once you complete your treatment program, you receive a plan for aftercare and recovery specifically tailored to your recovery needs.</p>
<p>Treatment programs offering an individualized approach help to empower people throughout the treatment and recovery process. Learn to love yourself, trust yourself and believe in yourself again. Learn to forgive yourself. A multi-disciplined approach to treatment allows you to restructure unhealthy beliefs and behaviors. Through evidence-based treatment, you learn how to become healthy again. Learn how to reward yourself without resorting to alcohol and drugs. The individualized approach to treatment helps you develop other techniques and tools to lessen your risk of relapse, such as developing healthy eating and exercise habits.</p>
<p>Completing long-term drug and alcohol treatment provides the best chances for breaking the cycle of addiction. Just because you complete treatment successfully does not mean you walk out of the treatment facility and find yourself suddenly cured of your addiction. Your treatment program prepares you for the day that treatment ends, prepares you for aftercare and even informs you about relapse and relapse prevention. <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/">Pathways Real Life Recovery in Utah</a> helps people to build and repair the relationships that were damaged by their addiction and puts a support system in place that effectively eliminates the triggers and thoughts that would drive them to use in the first place.
