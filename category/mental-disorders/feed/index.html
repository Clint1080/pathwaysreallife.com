According to the National Institute of Health (NIH) Over <a title="Mental Illness- National Institute of Mental Health" href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20there%20were%20an,20.6%25%20of%20all%20U.S.%20adults." target="_blank" rel="noopener">20% of adults</a> in the country have a mental illness, but only around 45% of those receive behavioral healthcare (2019). The lack of local access to mental health services, cost of treatment, societal stigma, and other factors contribute to the widespread inability to get treatment. Telehealthcare removes obstacles to receiving mental health care. Virtual therapy sessions are enabling more and more people with mental health issues to succeed in their lives.</p>
<p><span id="more-5931"></span></p>
<h2>Suffering Without Mental Health Treatment</h2>
<p>People with untreated mental illness often suffer from social isolation, loss of key relationships, and difficulty maintaining employment. In addition to their loss of human connections, there are numerous potential <a title="Dual Diagnosis Treatment for Co-Occurring Disorders in Utah - Pathways Residential Inpatient Treatment Services in Glenwood, Utah - Residential Rehab Treatment in Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/dual-diagnosis-treatment-co-occuring-disorders-utah/">comorbidities with mental illness</a>. These can include sleep disorders, depression, <a title="Customized Addiction Treatment Programs Available- We Accept Most Insurance Plans and Offer Financing Options" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/programs/">drug or alcohol addiction</a>, heart disease, gastrointestinal problems, obesity, and others.</p>
<h2>How Can Telemedicine Support Mental Health?</h2>
<h3>More Available Therapists</h3>
<p>Using telemedicine to deliver <a title="Behavioral Health Treatment Services- Anxiety, Depression, Grief, Trauma, Abuse, Marriage, Family, And Addiction Issues" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/mental-health-services/">mental health care</a> can help reduce the current shortage of mental health treatment providers. From licensed therapists to psychiatrists, mental health care specialists’ availability is decreasing throughout the country. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services research predicts that there will be an increasing shortage of mental health care providers over the coming years. The DHHS predicts that shortages will become severe in multiple areas of services by 2025. With the ability to provide care by telehealth appointment, healthcare professionals can more effectively maximize availability.</p>
<h3>Ease of Treatment Access</h3>
<p>Meeting with the therapist remotely, instead of being required to drive to the medical office eliminates the burden of commuting to therapy. This can enable busy parents, rural patients, overworked professionals, small business sole proprietors, handicapped patients, elderly people, patients without vehicles, and others to attend therapy.</p>
<h3>More Cost-Efficient Treatment</h3>
<p>Virtual care can be expected to be more cost-effective for providers and patients. Paying for teletherapy, vs. treatment at a medical office or emergency room can be more affordable for uninsured patients and those who have exceeded their maximum insurance benefits for mental health care. Plus, transportation, child care, lost work, and other costs for treatment are eliminated.</p>
<h3>More Consistent Treatment</h3>
<p>For many people who need mental health treatment, their personal circumstances are unstable, leading to disruptions of their mental health care routines. For example, they may struggle with job losses, financial distress, eviction, unexpected relocation, broken primary relationships, and other shocks to their mental health care routine. With virtual treatment sessions, the patient can more easily continue with a therapist, even when their personal circumstances change.</p>
<h3>Less Stressful to Dual-Diagnosed Patients</h3>
<p>People with comorbidities account for a staggering 70% of all patients of behavioral healthcare providers. Patients requiring multiple forms of medical treatment like addiction and combined therapies are met with special challenges. They must cope with multiple health conditions simultaneously and meet more intensive attendance demands if they want to receive all the treatment they need. Virtual treatment sessions make it possible for them to receive more therapy with less physically demanding attendance.</p>
<h3>Helps Therapists Develop Deeper Insights</h3>
<p>Mental healthcare providers can naturally develop deeper insights into patients’ problems and solutions when they can meet with them virtually in their homes. Spending time in the patient’s personal environment allows the <a title="Tips to Choosing a Therapist in Utah Who’s a Good Match for You" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/choosing-a-therapist-in-utah-whos-a-good-match-for-you/">therapist</a> to observe their habits of self-care, their living environment, family dynamics, and other helpful diagnostic and treatment information.</p>
<h3>Ease of Professional Collaboration</h3>
<p>Telecom innovations have made collaboration between mental healthcare providers and relevant specialists much more accessible, for more robust programs of ongoing engagement. This means care providers are no longer relatively isolated from others during treatment. They can now work with other clinicians via virtual sessions, to deliver comprehensive treatment. This approach can reduce the need for hospitalization and enable care providers to manage mental illness, stabilize patients and help prevent escalation of crises that lead to inpatient admissions.</p>
<h3>More Conducive to Patient Bonding</h3>
<p>Receiving mental health care inside the comforting surroundings of their own home can help many patients feel more secure and less apprehensive and self-protective. It can allow them to feel freer to connect at a deeper level of trust and be more open to productive teamwork with their mental health care providers.</p>
<h3>Alleviates Worries About Stigma</h3>
<p>Receiving therapy via telemedicine technology helps reduce the fear of the stigma of mental illness that is common for people with anxiety about being discovered entering a mental health treatment center. That fear causes many patients to avoid seeking the care they need. Telemedicine allows them to utilize mental health services privately, in their own home.</p>
<h3>Enables Remote Addiction Treatment</h3>
<p>Telemedicine is proving effective in providing broader treatment for people afflicted with opioids, methamphetamine, alcohol, and other addictions. Drug and alcohol addiction have become vast national crises in the United States. The problems are as rampant in rural areas as in urban neighborhoods, but the majority of addiction treatment facilities are in or near cities. Treatment sessions via virtual meeting technology can enable people to receive addiction treatment wherever they live.</p>
<h3>Makes Treatment More Affordable</h3>
<p>For women with children, allocating funds for childcare in order to attend therapy is cost-prohibitive. For students and other young people struggling with severely limited finances, senior citizens on a fixed income, and low-income patients, telemedicine makes therapy affordable for more people.</p>
<h2>The Telemedical Mental Health Treatment Solution</h2>
<p>The U.S. healthcare system has been challenged for a long time to meet the country’s ever-increasing needs for access to behavioral healthcare. In fact, insufficient access to mental health treatment has become a serious deficiency in the overall healthcare system over the past decade.</p>
<p>Naturally, telehealth services cannot be expected to resolve all treatment issues for all patients who need help with issues of mental illness. However, advanced technology can accomplish an extraordinary amount of improvement in the system, by helping people connect to the essential <a title="Get Started on Your Pathway to Recovery!- Fill Up This Online Form" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/online-forms/">mental health resources</a> for living healthier lives.</p>

If you are blessed with a perfect family, a good job, stable finances, and a happy life, you should be grateful. Sparing that one minute to thank what you already have is what it takes to make your experience even more joyful.</p>
<p><span id="more-5801"></span></p>
<p>So before we go any further, what exactly does gratitude mean? The word originates from a Latin word gratia. It is the state of being grateful or showing thankfulness. To understand how the power of gratitude works, we are going to look at the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>Gratitude and happiness</li>
<li>Gratitude and health</li>
<li>Gratitude and professional commitment</li>
<li>Neuroscience of gratitude</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gratitude and Happiness</h2>
<p>Gratitude can improve your interpersonal relationship both at home and at work. This can bring you happiness. When you show appreciation to yourself and others, you induce a positive emotion, which is technically happiness. So our overall health and wellbeing are impacted by the feelings of pleasure and contentment derived from gratitude.</p>
<p>According to a study conducted by the British psychologist Robert Holden, 65 percent of people choose happiness over health. However, both are of equal magnitude as far as good health is concerned. So in his study, he concluded that the state of unhappiness is the root of many psychopathological conditions like depression and stress, to mention a few.</p>
<h2>Gratitude and Health</h2>
<p>According to some researches, grateful people are healthy and happy. This is because they have low stress and depression levels, and they can cope better with adversity, and above all, they can sleep better. These people tend to be happier and are likely satisfied with life. So on top of being grateful, keeping a gratitude journal is also beneficial to your health. It reduces the stress level, improves the quality of sleep, and also builds emotional awareness.</p>
<h2>Gratitude and Professional Commitment</h2>
<p>If you want to build your professional commitment, then be grateful. Grateful employees are more efficient, productive, and above all, responsible. Showing gratitude at the workplace imperative in building an interpersonal relationship with colleagues. It can trigger feelings of closeness and bonding. If you are an employee who shows gratitude, then you likely to be loved by others.</p>
<h2>Neuroscience of Gratitude</h2>
<p>According to neuroscience research, there is a link between positive thoughts and activation of certain neurotransmitters. Putting the technicalities aside, if you focus your attention on things you are grateful for, you stimulate neurotransmitters in your brain (dopamine and serotonin) to promote contentment.</p>
<p>The study of neuroscience and gratitude is broad and would probably take a whole chapter just looking at it. What you need to understand is that people have different neurochemicals in their central nervous system, and this is why some are naturally grateful than others. If someone expresses and feels gratitude, it means he or he has more grey matter in their right inferior temporal gyrus.</p>
<p>Now that you understand the benefits of gratitude and its impacts on your life, it would be better to learn how you can practice it. So the question is, how to practice gratitude? The following are a few ways of practicing gratitude.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a gratitude journal.</li>
<li>Show love to someone and tell him or her how much you appreciate them.</li>
<li>Nature the friendship you have</li>
<li>Smile regularly</li>
<li>Spend each day showing kindness</li>
</ul>

But for many people, this time can bring or worsen anxiety, depression, and stress. This can be caused by many factors which may include increased financial burden as a result of travel, gifts and hotel charges. You may also be overwhelmed since the holiday season includes lots of parties, traveling, and performances which are difficult to balance with everyday self-care and responsibilities. </span><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Pathways Real Life Recovery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> offers mental health counseling services in Sandy, Utah. </span><b><i>If you experience one of the above challenges, the following are tips that you can use to manage your increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression during your holiday</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-5077"></span></p>
<h2>1. Improve Your Physical Health</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can introduce some form of regular exercise during the holiday. </span><b><i>Exercise strengthens the lungs and heart and also releases dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and endorphins that have an energizing effect and lift our mood</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. The effects of exercise are felt instantly, unlike medication which can take several weeks to kick in. Exercise also contributes to a more positive body image, which can be helpful for those wishing to increase their self-esteem and self-confidence.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>2. Build Your Resilience</strong><br />
</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You should build your emotional resilience to cope with ups and downs during a holiday. </span><b><i>Resilience is our ability to maintain or recover good feeling about ourselves, independent of the environment we may find ourselves in</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Emotional resilience can be achieved in many ways, but the most crucial is by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Talking to someone,</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> e.g., to a friend, family member or a counselor, because communication releases tension that may build up inside.</span></li>
<li><b>Improving your self-esteem &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> this is particularly important since many situations in our lives, such as relationship break-ups, not getting the job we want, can dramatically lower our self-esteem. People wishing to improve their self-esteem must treat themselves in a positive but honest way.</span></li>
<li><b>Managing your stress levels &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> reduce your working hours, ask for help, get some regular &#8216;me-time&#8217; when you can completely relax and unwind by developing good relationships with your friends, family or your partner.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Take Care of Yourself</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Paying attention to your own feeling and needs is essential. </span><b><i>You must try to achieve a balance between what you enjoy and your daily responsibilities, in order to prevent a build-up of stress and negative emotions</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Consider learning and discovering new things. Research has proved that by simply walking a small distance when on holiday can reduce stress and blood pressure naturally. Finally, </span><b><i>avoid drugs and alcohol to cope</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Even though escaping may sound appealing, drugs and alcohol actually worsen symptoms. </span><b><i>Choosing a well-balanced diet and drinking water over alcohol is guaranteed that you will feel much better, both physically and emotionally</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />

The reason is simple,  Gratitude! Gratefulness is a mental attitude completely independent of our circumstances and it can be developed. <strong><em>For those who are recovering from addiction, cultivating this positive outlook helps assure their future success. Having a grateful perception of the world around us can change roadblocks into opportunities &#8212; the &#8220;bad&#8221; into &#8220;good&#8221;. </em></strong>Out of challenges spring the fountain of growth.</p>
<p><span id="more-4499"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Do We Really Know What Gratitude Is?</strong></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to feel &#8220;grateful&#8221; when something good happens. But is this really what gratefulness is all about? <em><strong>Gratitude is defined as the recognition of benefits derived from something received.</strong> <strong>We can be grateful for an event, gift, favor, opportunity, circumstance, weather, etc</strong></em>. We can also be grateful as a general attitude toward life, seeing the world around us in a positive and productive light when a &#8220;normal&#8221; reaction would not be gratefulness. On the inverse, one can show signs of gratefulness, when they feel none. <em><strong>Gratitude is also about expressing thanks toward others. The simple act of thanking someone or showing appreciation to a family member or friend with regard to what they mean to you</strong></em> &#8212; not necessarily what they have done or do for you. Expressing gratitude helps us remember what is truly important &#8212; friends, family, health, security, among other more personal things. Gratitude should also be expressed toward yourself. It may sound silly or, to some, selfish to thank yourself. <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/5-reasons-to-be-thankful-while-in-recovery/">You cannot truly be grateful toward others is you do not thank yourself </a>for caring for yourself, seeking help when you needed it, learning to trust others.</p>
<h2><strong>The Benefits of Showing Gratitude</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Better Mental Health</strong> &#8212; We develop a more positive outlook, becoming stronger as we face challenges. We can think more clearly as the fog subsides and our immune and nervous systems heal, leading to fewer aches and pains which have been shown to be directly linked to our state of mind. Sleep becomes less turbulent, allowing for longer hours asleep, waking refreshed. We feel more connected to the people and the world around us.</p>
<p><strong>Better Physical Health</strong> &#8212; Blood pressure goes down and we feel more like moving around, getting exercise and doing things that we enjoy with more interest, joy, and fervor.</p>
<p><strong>Better Long Term Outlook</strong> &#8212; When we are grateful, we are <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/7-drug-alcohol-relapse-prevention-tips-recovery/">less likely to relapse </a>into <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/adult-teen-adolescent-behavioral-health-clinic-utah/">damaging behaviors</a>. Someone who may be considering turning back to their addiction for comfort can focus on those things that they are grateful for in order to realize that that is not a path to which they wish to return.</p>
<h2><strong>How Can We Become More Grateful?</strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>It is important to recognize that &#8220;gratitude is an attitude&#8221;. It&#8217;s not an emotion</strong></em>. We have full control over our gratefulness. But like anything, it requires a decision on our part to form a new healthy habit. According to some research, a habit can be formed in only 90 days. First, seek out things to be grateful for as much as possible. And very quickly it will become automatic well before 90 days.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Wake up with morning gratitude &#8212; </strong>Sit in a quiet place and think of all the things you are grateful for before you begin your day.</li>
<li><strong>Write down a list of gratitudes</strong> &#8212; Keep it in a pocket. And pull it out if you start thinking negatively. It can be a list or if you are more auditory, a message on your phone.</li>
<li><strong>Keep a gratitude journal &#8212; </strong>There are great apps available. <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/benefits-journaling-addiction-recovery/">Learn more about the benefits of journaling in recovery here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Reject comparisons </strong>&#8212; Be grateful for what you have and who you are. Comparisons are useless because there is no way to see and know the whole person.</li>
<li><strong>Help others </strong>&#8212; When we help others, it helps us better appreciate what we have. But be humble when helping others. Remember to reject comparisons. Being humble allows for the cultivation of gratitude. For those newly recovering, it could be something as simple as making coffee for meetings, holding the door, helping fold chairs.</li>
<li><strong>Find Comfort in Meditation and Prayer</strong> &#8212; We need quiet reflection time to heal and become more grateful. Whether this is meditation or prayer, make time to for yourself.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='Inward and Outward: How External Behavior and Addiction Are An Ongoing Cycle' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/inward-outward-external-behavior-addiction-ongoing-cycle/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><h2><strong>What Are Externalizing Behaviors?</strong></h2>
<p>Externalizing behaviors are directed outward, towards our environment and the people in it – everything from our jobs, to our friends and our families, to the person standing behind us in line at the coffee shop, or the clerk ringing up the sale. <em><strong>Instead of expressing negative emotion or anger in a productive way that addresses the problem directly, our reactions are directed at ‘innocent bystanders” in our immediate vicinity.</strong></em></p>
<p><span id="more-4413"></span></p>
<p>Some of these aggressive behaviors can run the gamut from irritability to verbal abuse or aggression, and can escalate to physical intimidation, bullying, and develop into dangerous or criminal action such as vandalism, theft, and assault.</p>
<h2>Externalizing Behaviors and Addiction</h2>
<p>Addictions can often develop from these patterns of behavior, usually as crutches or coping mechanisms for the individual. Saying <em><strong>“My boss is making life unbearable, so I need that drink,” is another way of justifying the behavior or actions and blaming other external elements.</strong> </em>Some of these addictive behaviors are drinking, drug use and gambling, and sexual activity or promiscuity, and the addict/externalizer will often do anything to remain unchanged and free of responsibility while compelling those around him or her to fit a certain comfort level.</p>
<p><strong>Externalizing Behavior Disorders</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) – <em>Subtype: Delinquent</em></span><br />
&#8211; Defiant, obstructive, argumentative behavior<br />
&#8211; Six months or more of continued non-compliant behavior pattern<br />
&#8211; Impairment of social, academic, or professional function</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conduct Disorder (CD) – <em>Subtype: Aggressive</em></span><br />
&#8211; Aggression and blatant violation of rules or directives<br />
&#8211; Aggression to people and animals/harm to same<br />
&#8211; Lying, theft, and patterns of deception<br />
&#8211; Serious violation of social rules and laws</p>
<h2>Adolescent Vulnerability – Why Children and Teens May Exhibit Externalizing Behavior</h2>
<p><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/parent-child-therapy/">Children</a> and <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/adolescent-treatment-utah/">Teenagers are particularly vulnerable</a> because of the natural shifts and changes in their biology and development.  Certain environmental, internal, or genetic factors can add to those stresses and result in <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/adult-teen-adolescent-behavioral-health-clinic-utah/">externalizing behaviors</a>. Some of these factors include physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, or loss of loved ones to death or removal from the environment. Physical and emotional trauma – domestic violence, instability, substance abuse – can also be huge elements in the development of aggressive or counterproductive behaviors.</p>
<p>There are internal factors singular to the individual, from mental illness or personality disorder to a learning disorder, physical trauma or physical disability, which can cause a gamut of stress and insecurity in a <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/benefits-parent-child-interaction-therapy">developing child’s brain and behaviors</a>. Children and teens may opt to keep their disability or disorder a secret, for fear of ridicule or being ostracized. Their externalized behaviors can then lead to expulsion from school – which is much more preferable than isolation from peers. Results can escalate to arrest or detainment by authorities, and carry greater risk of criminal patters and incarceration.</p>
<h2>Treatment for Children, Teens and Adults in Utah</h2>
<p>When presented with the need for treatment, the externalizer will also often rationalize the many reasons why they <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/changing-core-beliefs-emotional-reactions-behaviors/">engage in these patterns and why they need those behaviors to cope</a> – to insulate themselves against pain, sadness, intimidation or feelings of inadequacy, or to avoid confronting the root issue.  Sometimes the reasoning can be as simple for them as “I feel better when I drink, because it makes me feel happy”.  These rationales need to be identified head on, and the positive possibilities of treatment presented with equal clarity. Counseling, therapy, and sometimes medication are all options that can be discussed and reviewed, but it’s important that not only the individual receive help and intervention – it’s equally important for him or her to realize that a full, functional, and productive life is possible with the right tools, knowledge, and therapy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='Tips to Beat Holiday Depression and Anxiety' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/tips-beat-holiday-depression-anxiety/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p class="ffb-id-pk3copb fg-paragraph text-left    fg-text-dark">Even the happiest people sometimes experience holiday blues. With so many things to juggle at once, it’s not uncommon to feel down during the “most wonderful time of the year.” Especially for those prone to depression and anxiety, November and December can be particularly difficult to navigate with a smile.</p>
<p><span id="more-2179"></span></p>
<p>What causes the holiday blues? Everybody’s different, and the triggers vary. <a href="http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/2015/10/sarah-silverman-on-i-smile-back-and-battle-with-depression">As comedian Sarah Silverman describes depression</a>, “it feels like it’s coming over me like a flu.” Depression can be as sudden and unexpected as any other illness. Sometimes it hits us when we least expect it – and it’s never convenient or fun.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I can only speak from my own experience, and I would say that the depression I experienced feels like a chemical change," she said. &#8220;When it came over me, when it comes over me, it feels like it&#8217;s coming over me like a flu. You ever just sit &#8230; and you&#8217;re fine and the next moment you just go, &#8216;Oh, Jesus, I have the flu.'"</p></blockquote>
<p>However, there are some common factors you can be aware of that add unwanted stress during the holiday season:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Unrealistic expectations</li>
<li>Constant commercialization</li>
<li>Visitors and family reunions</li>
<li>Distance from friends or family</li>
<li>Parties</li>
<li>Traffic</li>
<li>Drastic changes in weather</li>
<li>and more</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, many people who rarely suffer from stress have reported headaches, insomnia, and other stress symptoms during the holidays. This annual visit from depression and anxiety leaves its mark and darkens what could otherwise be a bright time of joy.</p>
<p>The good news is that, with some focused preparation, you can find that joy again. Follow these tips to bid the holiday blues farewell:</p>
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5">Plan Ahead…</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/holiday-tips.jpg" alt="Plan ahead so you don't fall behind. If you know you will have anxiety during the holidays, plan for it." width="407" height="612" align="left" style="margin:0px 10px 10px 0px" />You know it’s coming, and that gives you the upper hand on depression and anxiety. This season, devote some time to creating restorative routines. Identify what calms you and build that into your regular schedule. Read a book. Chat with a friend. Take a nap. Make these priorities so they never get skipped during your busy day.</p>
<p><strong>For your travel.</strong></p>
<p>It’s hard to feel relaxed when you have to rush to the airport or train station, wondering all the way whether you’ve left something important at home. Get your arrangements booked as early as possible and confirm them to make sure your transportation, hotel, rental car, and other necessities are in order. Prepare extra time to pack and double check your tickets, identification, and medications so you can head out with confidence.</p>
<p><strong>For your feelings.</strong></p>
<p>The holidays are actually designed to encourage a variety of feelings. Some are joyful, but others tend to open the door to negativity if you aren’t careful. Remind yourself that quiet contemplation on your feelings – all of them – is normal and healthy, especially at this time of year. Write down things that upset you and answer questions like “What do I wish were happening instead?” This conversation with yourself can actually help manage depression.</p>
<p><strong>For your health.</strong></p>
<p>We know you’re slammed with tons of things to do. For many of us, it’s tempting to let exercise take a back seat to more urgent priorities. The reality, though, is that exercise is one of the best natural mood enhancers available, and lack of exercise is one of the strongest ingredients for anxiety. Do your body and your emotions a favor and take that brisk walk as often as you can.</p>
<p><strong>For your relationships.</strong></p>
<p>Most of us have at least one Grinch in our lives. Think ahead about how to defuse potentially negative situations with your family’s source of conflict. You can prepare a bank of polite responses that allow you to end the conversation or delay it until you’ve calmed down. Try positive statements like “Maybe we can talk about this again later” or “Thanks for letting me know how you feel.” Then get back to enjoying your day, argument-free.</p>
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5">Make New Traditions</strong></h2>
<p>Traditions are a source of joy for many people, but sometimes our traditions cause us stress. Maybe they remind us of sad things. Maybe they won’t fit into everyone’s schedule this year.</p>
<p>That’s okay. The best thing about traditions is that they are flexible. They grow with you and your family. Don’t be afraid to change things up this year if it will help you heal.</p>
<p>Some family members will be excited to try something new, but not everyone is comfortable with change. This is also fine. Be considerate of your family’s feelings, and make any adjustments to traditions gently and with kindness. Positivity is the theme for this season!</p>
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5">Focus on What Matters Most</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/christmas-depression-treatment.jpg" alt="The parent child relationship is very important when trying to beat depression and anxiety" width="400" height="227" align="left" style="margin:0px 10px 10px 0px" />Spoiler alert: it’s not the presents, it is love and friendship.</p>
<p>Some people will choose to give expensive presents because they have money to spare, but little free time. They may choose to show their love by buying gifts.</p>
<p>Others may not have a lot of money to spare, but they will devote their energy to creating personal gifts at home. They’re showing love in their way.</p>
<p>Both the expensive presents and the hand-made gifts are equally valuable.</p>
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5">Say No Sometimes</strong></h2>
<p>It’s so easy to overburden yourself during the holidays. Give yourself the freedom to say no to a few invitations. Let your friends know you’re grateful they thought of you, but you already have another obligation – even if that obligation is actually private time with yourself!</p>
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5">Eat and Drink Responsibly</strong></h2>
<p>Try feasting slowly; our brains take a few minutes to catch up to our stomachs, and sometimes we feel hungry for a short while after we’re actually full. There’s no need to fill your plate on your first trip. If you’re still hungry several minutes after eating, you can always get seconds!</p>
<p>Also, remember that alcohol can make your emotions more intense than usual. Keep this in mind when you’re breaking out the wine or egg nog this holiday season. Have whatever is a reasonable amount for you, but listen to your body. Relax and take it slowly.</p>
<p>With careful preparation, positivity, and focused attention to your body and emotional needs, you can take this tricky time of year and turn it into the glowing, joyful season.</p>

But while mental disorders alone may seem difficult, a disorder coupled with a substance addiction can prove far more devastating to everyone involved. And unfortunately, it is all too common for mental disorders to either exacerbate problems with substance abuse, or lead to them altogether. Here is how some mental disorders may lead to addiction, and what you can do to prevent this from happening:</p>

<h2><b>A Temporary Solution</b></h2>
<p>Depending on the nature of the mental disorder, individuals may find substances, such as drugs and alcohol, to act as temporary solutions to emotional manifestations of the ailment. Those who suffer from illnesses such as depression or manic depression, schizophrenia, and even paranoia may find that specific substances may lessen the symptoms for a period of time, acting as a short reprieve from the current realities.</p>
<p>Naturally though, while the individual may believe that the substance or substances may ease the pain, truthfully the combination of a mental disorder and burgeoning addiction can lead to further problems down the road.</p>
<h2><b>Easy Access to Drugs and Alcohol</b></h2>
<p>Although the living situations of those suffering from mental disorders are sure to vary drastically depending on the individual, such maladies often contribute to the sufferer receding from a social circle, losing possible gainful employment, and even potentially becoming homeless or destitute as a result. And though a lack of shelter and drug addiction are not synonymous, they do often appear together. Those plagued with a mental disorder that find themselves in poor economic shape may have easier access to drugs and alcohol, and may use these substances again to escape from the realities of their life and illness.</p>
<h2><b>A Way to Help</b></h2>
<p>For some that have a mental disorder, the option or idea of turning to substances for reprieve may never present itself, or may not even sound like an appealing venture.</p>
<p>For those that do find themselves tempted by drugs and alcohol, it is extremely important for friends and family members close to them to diligently work in order to prevent the perpetuation of the cycle. Close friends and family can help by offering to spend time with the individual, suggesting they engage in physical activity, and helping them find treatment options for their existing mental disorder.</p>
<p>Clearly though, if an individual suffering from a mental disorder does turn to substance abuse, it is imperative that surrounding acquaintances act quickly to help them move away from self-medication. Friends and family members can help by allowing the individual to recognize the problem on their own, confronting the sufferer directly, or even seeking out a treatment facility that can act as a sanctuary to help achieve a desired level of mental health.</p>
