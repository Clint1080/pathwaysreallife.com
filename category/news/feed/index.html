It causes changes in the neural pathways that remember the <em>pleasures</em> of activities such as eating, sex, alcohol and drug use, gambling, etc. When triggered, these pleasurable memories cause an overwhelming desire to repeat the experience. Without the proper skills to overcome this desire, and without dealing with the root causes of the issues that led to the addictions to begin with, it’s easy to fall into the cycle of addiction. After all, pleasure is a hard thing to resist.<br />
<span id="more-3674"></span></p>
<p>With this in mind, let’s look at 5 things about addiction that may surprise you.</p>
<h2>D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) Causes More Harm than Good</h2>
<p>Founded by a former police officer with the help of Los Angeles schools, the goal of the D.A.R.E. program is to decrease drug use in schools. Although the program sounds ideal and has great intentions, D.A.R.E. has failed to reach its objectives. Peer reviews and studies have shown that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-just-say-no-doesnt-work/?page=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D.A.R.E. program may actually increase the likelihood for teens to drink and smoke</a>.</li>
<li>The program possibly <a href="https://www.alcoholfacts.org/DARE.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increased drug use among teenage girls</a>.</li>
<li>It was determined “that D.A.R.E. simply didn’t work” in a study done for the U.S. Bureau of Justice Assistance.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Trading Addictions</h2>
<p>If a person beats their addiction to drugs or alcohol, but have not dealt with the underlying issues that led to their addictive behavior in the first place, they often find themselves addicted to another drug or substance. This is called cross addiction. It also explains why people often develop a new addiction, such as that to sugary or fatty foods, after completing treatment. Unfortunately, this new addiction often leads the person back to their original drug of choice, starting the cycle all over again.</p>
<h2>You Can Be Addicted to Practically Anything</h2>
<p>According to <strong>Psychology Today</strong>, addiction is a condition that occurs when a person ingests a substance or engages in a pleasurable activity to the point that it becomes compulsive and interferes with ordinary life responsibilities.</p>
<h2>You really can be addicted to almost anything. Examples of addictive substances include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol</li>
<li>Drugs: cocaine, heroine, meth-amphetamines, opiates, etc.</li>
<li>Nicotine</li>
<li>Caffeine</li>
<li>Many different prescription medications</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of addictive behaviors or activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gambling</li>
<li>Sex</li>
<li>Shopping</li>
<li>Pornography</li>
<li>Overeating</li>
<li>Video games</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people think that overcoming an addiction to something like gambling can’t be as difficult as overcoming an addiction to nicotine or heroine. However, research shows that gambling addicts may suffer physical withdrawal symptoms that rival those of drug withdrawals. The symptoms include difficulty breathing, heart palpitations, and pain throughout the body, proving that addiction is more about a set of behaviors than the properties of the addictive substances.</p>
<p>Caffeine is another of those “innocent” addictions. In fact, it is often joked about and viewed as not much of a problem. It is so addicting that people often experience problems giving it up even when advised to do so by their health care providers.</p>
<h2>Alcoholics Anonymous</h2>
<p>Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the original 12-step program designed to overcome alcohol addiction. It was adapted to deal with narcotic addictions as well. It is often the first step someone takes when they decide to deal with their substance abuse and addictions. Some people have found success in these 12-step programs, while others have not.</p>
<p>Alcoholics Anonymous has an incredibly strong faith-based component. Acknowledgement of a higher power, often God, and the need to rely on that power to “restore one to sanity” is an integral part of the program. This component can make some people quite uncomfortable. It also encourages people to believe they are incapable of handling the problem on their own, without a higher power.</p>
<p>Contrary to AA’s belief “once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic,” we at Pathways believe that with proper treatment and learning to deal with the root cause of the problem, the need to take part in addictive behaviors goes away.</p>
<h2>Treating the Real Cause of Addiction</h2>
<p>Since addictions cause problems that disrupt people’s lives, it’s easy to jump to the conclusion that the addiction is the problem. Following that logic, once the addiction is addressed and the addictive behavior has ceased, then the problem is fixed. The problem with this way of thinking, however, is that the “real” problem has not been dealt with. This means that the addictive behavior is likely to return as the person continues to seek a way to relieve the “real” pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>In his book, <em>Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days in the War on Drugs</em>, Johann Hari shares that addiction actually has very little to do with the drugs themselves. Instead, he argues that the real cause is the lack of proper bonds with other humans. In other words, people are forming a bond to their addiction to fill the void in that area of their lives.</p>
<h2>Get Real Help with Pathways Real Life Recovery Program</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='Utah Suicide Prevention' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/utah-suicide-prevention/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><h2>Being Mindful of the Way We Talk About Suicide</h2>
<p>The recent untimely death of Robin Williams shed new light on suicide, depression and other mental health issues. The media coverage of his death called attention to both proper and improper ways reports of suicide should be handled by the press. Some reporters focused on how Williams died. Others questioned why someone so successful and wealthy wanted to die. Some political pundits and religious zealots tried to place blame. One even called Williams a coward. Another referred to him as a sinner. The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP), along with a number of other organizations, has written guidelines for the media to follow when reporting on suicide. <span id="more-3198"></span> The guidelines emphasize the need to strike a balance between reporting on the death without sensationalizing it. The media should resist providing specific details and instead focus generally on suicide as being a public health issue that affects everyone. Photos should be of the deceased at work or with family members. Photos of the scene where the death occurred or of grieving family members should be avoided. Informed reporters will mention risk factors and present warning signs that many folks who are suicidal may exhibit. Suicide prevention experts should be interviewed and focus placed on prevention, not sensationalism. A suicide prevention hotline phone number should be provided to viewers or listeners. The goal is to encourage potential “copycats” to seek help and prevent them from taking their own lives. This is an opportunity for news media to change public misperceptions about suicide and to avoid graphic and dramatic headlines.</p>

<h2><b>Suicide risk factors</b></h2>
<p>Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. Different age and ethnic groups and genders have different risk factors. But, the biggest risk factor encompassing all groups is clinical depression. Ninety percent of all suicide victims suffered from either depression or some other mental disorder. Substance abuse is often found in conjunction with the depression or mental health problem. Nearly 50 percent of those who die by suicide have made a previous suicide attempt. Those suffering from a chronic illness or pain or who have a history of physical or sexual abuse are high suicide risks. Prolonged stress caused by, among other things, unemployment, financial loss, relationship struggles or bullying also create suicide risks. The odds of suicide increase when a person suffers from more than one risk factor at the same time or has a family history of mental illness or suicide. In addition to risk factors, those who are close to taking their own life often present warning signs.</p>
<h2><b>Suicide warning signs</b></h2>
<p>Not all of the nearly 40,000 people who commit suicide annually provide warning signs, but many of them do. Warning signs indicate the person may be in need of immediate help. Even if you recognize the warning signs, there may be nothing you can do to prevent the suicide. But, being aware of them may allow you an opportunity to intervene.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many talk about not wanting to live any more. They may say things like, “I want the pain to end” or “I just can’t go on any longer” or “I wish I were dead.”</li>
<li>They talk about feeling trapped and seeing no way out.</li>
<li>They may express feelings of being a burden to their family and other people.</li>
<li>They become isolated and lose interest in doing things they formerly enjoyed.</li>
<li>They may be very angry and talk about “getting even.”</li>
<li>They are irritable and angry a lot.</li>
<li>They focus on a way out, such as purchasing a gun or large quantities of medication.</li>
</ul>
<p>These things should all be taken seriously. If you can help, the main thing is not to judge or lecture. Saying, “You have so much to live for” or “Think about how sad your family will be” are not helpful. Telling the person you are concerned and care is helpful. Ask if the person has thought of a plan or method. Find out if they have a therapist. Encourage them to get help and offer to schedule an appointment and go with them. If the threat seems immediate, do not leave them alone. Remove objects such as guns and pills from where they have access to them. Take them to the ER if necessary and call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on their behalf at 1-800-273-8255.</p>
<h2><b>Utah Suicide Prevention Day</b></h2>

<p>The AFSP has set aside September 10, 2014, as a national suicide prevention day. All across the country, there will be Out of the Darkness walks to raise money for suicide awareness, education, research and prevention. Different states and cities have established different dates during that week for sponsoring their own walks. Join us as we walk to honor those we have lost to suicide and those who are currently struggling with suicide ideation. We walk to save lives. We walk to end the stigma of depression and mental disorders. We walk to give a voice to those who need one. New activities are being planned every day. There will be activities for kids, a silent auction, prize drawing, live music, food and fun. We will have a memory table where you can display a photo of your loved one. Create or join a team today. Of all funds raised, 50 percent stays in Utah! We hope to see you there! <strong>Saturday, September 13, 2014</strong> <strong>Registration begins at 9:00 a.m. PST</strong> <strong>Sugarhouse Park &#8211; </strong><strong>1350 E. 2100 S.   </strong><strong>Salt Lake City, Utah 84106</strong> </p>
