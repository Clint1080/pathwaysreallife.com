										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='Benefits of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT)' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/benefits-parent-child-interaction-therapy/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p class="ffb-id-pk3copb fg-paragraph text-left    fg-text-dark">If your young child is experiencing <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/adult-teen-adolescent-behavioral-health-clinic-utah/" title="Behavioral Health Treatment for Adults and Teens in Utah - Parent-Child Interaction Therapy near Salt Lake City Utah">behavioral problems</a>, you have likely tried many methods to attempt to correct these behaviors. Some of these methods may include punishment techniques or positive reinforcement methods. However, if you are not seeing any change in their behavior, you may begin to wonder what you as a parent are doing wrong.</p>
<p><span id="more-4347"></span></p>
<p>Despite your best efforts to remain calm and composed, parents can become tired and irritable when they are subjected to the same behaviors from their child over and over. When this happens, you may not act in such a way that we are making a positive impact on our child as they are disciplined. Unfortunately, your child can then pick up on your bad habits and mirror them, which may be part of the reason that they are acting out, because they see you doing so when you are frustrated. A parent&#8217;s frustration and stress directly relate to our children&#8217;s ability to <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/belief-restructuring/" title="Belief Restructuring Therapy - Parent-Child Interaction Therapist in Utah">process and react to their feelings and behaviors</a>. If you are in this situation, parent-child interaction therapy, or PCIT, may be ideal for you.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4344" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-child-interaction-therapy-pcit-utah.jpg" alt="Parent Child Interaction Therapy" width="600" height="400" title="Experience the benefits of parent child relationship therapy, call Pathways Real Life Recovery today - Parent Child Interaction Therapy in Utah" /><br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<p><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/parent-child-therapy/" title="Parent-child Interaction Therapy near Salt Lake City Utah - What are the benefits of parent child relationship therapy?">Parent-child interaction therapy</a> is a form of therapy for you, the parent. You receive coaching from a child psychology specialist on how to decrease your negative behaviors while improving upon your relationship with your child. This can help to curb behavioral problems in a child. PCIT is a specialized 15-20 session treatment program designed for parents or caregivers and their children aged 10 or younger who may be experiencing behavioral and/or emotional issues. Sessions are an hour long and are done weekly.</p>
<h2>Helps Children Manage Aggressive and Defiant Behaviors</h2>
<p>Parent-child interaction counseling helps target a wide range of <a href="http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/aggression/according-experts/effective-daycare-kindergarten-interventions-prevent-chronic-aggression">aggressive</a> and defiant behaviors in children. Some of those behaviors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swearing</li>
<li>Fighting</li>
<li>Temper tantrums</li>
<li>Refusal to obey rules</li>
<li>Arguing</li>
<li>Low self-esteem</li>
<li>Low frustration threshold</li>
<li>Lying</li>
<li>Blaming others for one&#8217;s actions</li>
</ul>
<p>With such a wide array of behaviors, you may be wondering how this type of counseling can help to solve all of these problems. In order to properly solve behavioral issues, you have to get to the root of the issue with the child. Most of the time, the behavior is one that is learned from the parent and the parent may inadvertently be doing so. For example, when you discipline your child, and they talk back, you may engage with them and argue. If you let them get away with this a couple of times, the habit is formed and it is hard to break without outside assistance. Learning how to break some of these bad habits, and learning techniques to follow yourself when you feel frustrated, will help your child see how to behave in situations. Over time, they will learn by your positive example.</p>
<div class="su-quote su-quote-style-default su-quote-has-cite"><div class="su-quote-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim">Research has shown that, as a result of PCIT, parents learn more effective parenting techniques, the behavior problem of children decrease, and the quality of the parent-child relationship improves.<span class="su-quote-cite">(U.S. Department of Human and Health Services, 2015)</span></div></div>
<h2>Helps Improve Parent-Child Relationships</h2>
<p>One of the biggest benefits to parent-child interaction therapy is that you can improve upon your relationship with your child. Many parents would love a better relationship with their child, but they simply don&#8217;t know how. This type of program teaches you how to communicate with and respect your child, while still asserting your parental position. Creating and establishing a positive relationship is much easier in younger children, so the earlier you start, the better.</p>
<h2>Helps Reduce Child Abuse</h2>
<p>The last benefit to parent-child interaction therapy is that it helps to <a href="http://encompassnw.org/parent-child-interaction-therapy-decreases-tension-and-improves-relationships/">reduce child abuse</a>. When parents are frustrated, they can say things that can be hurtful and emotionally abusive to a child. Unfortunately, they may not even realize because that&#8217;s how they were disciplined as a child. PCIT breaks the cycle of abuse and teaches you how to parent without emotionally or physically abusing your child.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='10 Tips for Parents to Prevent Teen Suicide' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/10-tips-parents-prevent-teen-suicide/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p>It is sad to lose a child and even more heartbreaking to suicide. As a child develops, it may get difficult for parents to know their feelings and thoughts. Adolescence has its high and low moments. However, a parent may not know when a <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/teen-depression-treatment-utah/">teen is depressed</a>. <em><strong>It&#8217;s essential to learn the possible factors that could cause severe depression to your kid that they <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/utah-suicide-prevention/">contemplate committing suicide</a></strong></em>.<br />
<strong>Here are some tips on how you could avert your child&#8217;s thoughts from suicide:</strong></p>
<h2><strong>1. Avoid Ignoring Suicide Threats</strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>Do not underestimate</strong></em> early suicidal signs. <em><strong><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/connections-between-mental-health-and-substance-abuse/">Teens may indulge in substance abuse</a> or merely isolate themselves</strong></em> from other family members. At times, the teenager issues <em><strong>verbal or written statements</strong></em> declaring their intentions to commit suicide. As a parent, you should <strong>take them seriously</strong>.</p>
<p>Often, kids mulling over suicide <em><strong>repeatedly inform</strong></em> their guardians and parents about it. Scientific studies reveal that such people <em><strong>don&#8217;t intend</strong></em> to kill themselves. Instead, the threats are usually a <strong>plea for urgent help and attention</strong>.</p>
<p>When your child starts issuing death threats, try to keep cool. Avoid displaying shock or scolding them. Spare some time to tentatively <em><strong>listen to your their concerns as you reassure them of your love and commitment</strong></em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-4819"></span></p>
<h2><strong>2. Consult a Certified Counselor</strong></h2>
<p>Promptly visit a pediatrician if your child&#8217;s strange behavior persists for a while. Alternatively, you can contact a nearby mental health specialist for her to evaluate your teen. He should start attending therapy sessions soon afterward if he is prone to self-harm.</p>
<p>You should also contact your psychological support team and mobilize it at a nearby emergency room. It&#8217;s essential to <em><strong>seek help right away</strong></em> if your kid is actively suicidal or if he intends to harm himself.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Control Your Child&#8217;s Anxiety</strong></h2>
<p>A child could have had a bad day. He should brighten up after a while. However, if his dampen spirit lasts for several days, you should get concerned. It&#8217;s proven that <em><strong>over 80% of American teens who commit suicide were once diagnosed with a mental disorder</strong></em>. <em>Most of them displayed intense anxiety and <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/teen-depression-treatment-utah/">depression</a>.</em></p>
<p>In most instances, depressed people become antisocial. However, they yearn to get <em><strong>rescued</strong></em> from their tabulations. They are <em><strong>often embarrassed</strong></em> to display their moodiness to loved ones. Its <em><strong>prevalent in boys</strong></em> as the society expects them to conceal their emotions.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Try to Figure Out Your Child&#8217;s Thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>Most teenagers who plan to commit suicide display strange actions and characters. Research has shown that in most families affected by teenage suicide have <em><strong>poor communications between parents and children</strong></em>.</p>
<p>However, other factors could lead to teen suicide. These include <em><strong>breakups, drug abuse, peer pressure, humiliation, impulsiveness and a severe medical condition</strong></em>. If your instinct cautions you that your kid wants to harm himself, take prudent measures. You need to learn how to <em><strong>communicate</strong></em> with and <em><strong>listen</strong></em> to your teen efficiently.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Express Your Feelings</strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>Assure your teen that you have their back</strong></em>. It&#8217;s normal for anyone to get anxious or depressed once in a while. It also happens in adults. <em><strong>Reassure them that tough times don&#8217;t last forever</strong></em> while avoiding aggravating their condition. It will encourage them to soldier on in life. They will eventually get through the depression after you enroll them in therapy sessions.</p>
<h2><strong>6. Discourage the Child from Isolating Himself</strong></h2>
<p>When facing a desperate situation in life, it isn&#8217;t wise to isolate yourself from other people. However, depressed teens tend to avoid being social. You should encourage your teen to have frequent walks in the neighborhood. It will help in <em><strong>distracting</strong></em> him from his troubles.</p>
<h2><strong>7. Remind Your Child to Be Patient</strong></h2>
<p>Talk therapies typically <em><strong>take time</strong></em> to improve an individual&#8217;s temperament. Your teen shouldn&#8217;t get discouraged in case his state doesn&#8217;t improve immediately. You should train him to be patient when expecting to see <em><strong>long-term life changes</strong></em>. Besides, he should strictly <em><strong>follow</strong></em> the therapy schedule without skipping any session.</p>
<h2><strong>8. Safely Store All Your Firearms</strong></h2>
<p>You should quickly store your weapons before your suicidal child picks it. A report from Brady Centre to Prevent Gun Violence reveals that in 2013, the number of American youth who committed suicide by firearms skyrocketed. It exceeded that of the previous 12 years. Most fatalities involved weapons <em><strong>possessed by a family member</strong></em>.</p>
<h2><strong>9. Urge Your Child Not To Pressurize Himself</strong></h2>
<p>Mental therapy takes time for its effects to be visible. Until he starts recuperating, avoid assigning numerous responsibilities to him. Urge him to <em><strong>divide complex tasks into smaller and manageable ones</strong></em>. He should also take part in <em><strong>leisure activities</strong></em>. The aim is to <em><strong>boost his confidence, self-esteem, and self-control</strong></em>.</p>
<h2><strong>10. Encourage Him to Work Out</strong></h2>
<p>Taking part in intense physical activities is essential. Working out <em><strong>stimulates the brain to produce endorphins</strong></em>. It&#8217;s a hormone that is said to <em><strong>enhance moods and relieving pain</strong></em>. Endorphins minimize the amount of cortisol circulating in the body. It is often associated with depression.<br />
A physical exercise distracts an individual from their challenges and enables them to have a higher self-appreciation. Physicians recommend work out sessions lasting up to thirty minutes a day. Your teen should work out three times a week for you to see significant improvement. However, you <em><strong>should select an activity that he enjoys</strong></em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='Toddler Tantrum Tips for Parents' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/toddler-tantrum-tips-parents/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p>If we haven’t witnessed them first-hand, we have all heard of the “terrible twos”, that period of time when toddlers are prone to throwing temper tantrums. In actuality, and unfortunately for parents and caregivers, tantrums don’t start the day a toddler turns two and end the day they turn three. Tantrums usually occur as children are going through normal developmental phases between the ages of 18 months to four years.</p>
<p>A tantrum should not be viewed as a negative thing, although it’s easy to feel that way in the moment. Toddlers aren’t intentionally trying to push our buttons. <strong><em>When a child throws a tantrum, he or she is actually creating or expressing their own individuality, and demonstrating that they can think for themselves.</em></strong> They don’t have the skills to express themselves differently at that age, which is where parents and caregivers need to both meet the child’s needs and help them learn how to cope with problems differently in the future.</p>
<p><span id="more-4393"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Why Toddlers Have Tantrums?</strong></h2>
<p>Temper tantrums in toddlers can stem from many different things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feeling like they can’t control their environment</li>
<li>Having too many limits</li>
<li>Having too few limits</li>
<li>A need to assert independence</li>
<li>Frustration because of their inability to communicate effectively</li>
<li>Being overtired</li>
<li>Feeling bored</li>
<li>Being overstimulated</li>
<li>Hunger</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Tips for Handling or Avoiding Tantrums</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Plan Ahead.</strong> The last four causes on the list above, being overtired, overstimulated, hungry or feeling bored, are the easiest to plan for and to avoid. Whenever you can control your toddler’s schedule, don’t plan activities or outings during naptime, and plan for snacks to keep hunger at bay. Bringing a favorite book or toy on an outing is a great way to stave off feelings of boredom. Understand your toddler’s limits when it comes to feeling overstimulated, and respect those limits as best you can.</li>
<li><strong>Set (and use) Boundaries</strong>. Boundaries are important for children at any stage of development, but they are especially important for toddlers. When children know what is expected of them, and when those expectations are enforced consistently, they will feel calmer. As any caregiver will tell you, this can be rough, especially in the beginning, and toddlers will push back on those boundaries to learn where they really are. Parents and caregivers need to have consistent messaging about boundaries and be fair and patient while still being fair.</li>
<li><strong>Build Relationship with Toddler</strong>. This one really comes down to getting to know the child better. When you know their emotions well, you’ll be in the best position to identify when they are close to feeling overstimulated, or overtired or simply frustrated. Some caregivers and parents have found keeping a journal to be beneficial, recording and documenting the situation, environment and circumstances present when the tantrum occurred, as well as details about the time period leading up to the tantrum. By doing this, often certain patterns emerge which can be helpful in avoiding repeat tantrums. On the flipside, instead of just paying attention to the tantrums, it is equally important to pay attention to what the child is doing well. <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/benefits-parent-child-interaction-therapy">Praising good behavior will help toddlers</a> start to make connections about what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Stand Your Ground.</strong> When a toddler is in the midst of a tantrum, all of the planning and journaling in the world cannot help you in that moment. The trick is to stand your ground and remain as calm as possible. For example, if your toddler pitches a fit when you won’t give him a cookie right before dinner, your response should be to repeat the rule, over and over: “We don’t eat cookies before dinner. We don’t eat cookies before dinner.” The trick is to be as consistent and as calm as possible. Keep your voice even and your face neutral. The toddler will understand that you mean business, and see that they can’t get a rise — or a cookie — out of you before dinner.<br />
When you refuse to be pulled into the tantrum, your child will see that you’re not wavering and that his or her activities aren’t getting them anywhere.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Toddler Tantrum Help in Utah at Pathways Real Life Recovery</h3>
<p>If your child throws frequent tantrums (twice or more each day), if his or her tantrums are accompanied by intense anger or sadness, or are followed by extreme separation anxiety, aggression or sleep-related problems, talk to your child’s doctor. Toddler tantrums generally end by age four, so consult your doctor if your child continues to throw regular tantrums after that age.</p>
<p>You should also talk to either your child’s doctor or to your own doctor if you’re feeling unable to cope with tantrums. Feeling overwhelmed and helpless during your child’s tantrums is normal; but know, that you don’t need to go it alone.</p>
