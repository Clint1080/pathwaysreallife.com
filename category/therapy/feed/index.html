										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='Benefits of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT)' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/benefits-parent-child-interaction-therapy/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p class="ffb-id-pk3copb fg-paragraph text-left    fg-text-dark">If your young child is experiencing <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/adult-teen-adolescent-behavioral-health-clinic-utah/" title="Behavioral Health Treatment for Adults and Teens in Utah - Parent-Child Interaction Therapy near Salt Lake City Utah">behavioral problems</a>, you have likely tried many methods to attempt to correct these behaviors. Some of these methods may include punishment techniques or positive reinforcement methods. However, if you are not seeing any change in their behavior, you may begin to wonder what you as a parent are doing wrong.</p>
<p><span id="more-4347"></span></p>
<p>Despite your best efforts to remain calm and composed, parents can become tired and irritable when they are subjected to the same behaviors from their child over and over. When this happens, you may not act in such a way that we are making a positive impact on our child as they are disciplined. Unfortunately, your child can then pick up on your bad habits and mirror them, which may be part of the reason that they are acting out, because they see you doing so when you are frustrated. A parent&#8217;s frustration and stress directly relate to our children&#8217;s ability to <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/belief-restructuring/" title="Belief Restructuring Therapy - Parent-Child Interaction Therapist in Utah">process and react to their feelings and behaviors</a>. If you are in this situation, parent-child interaction therapy, or PCIT, may be ideal for you.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4344" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-child-interaction-therapy-pcit-utah.jpg" alt="Parent Child Interaction Therapy" width="600" height="400" title="Experience the benefits of parent child relationship therapy, call Pathways Real Life Recovery today - Parent Child Interaction Therapy in Utah" /><br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<p><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/parent-child-therapy/" title="Parent-child Interaction Therapy near Salt Lake City Utah - What are the benefits of parent child relationship therapy?">Parent-child interaction therapy</a> is a form of therapy for you, the parent. You receive coaching from a child psychology specialist on how to decrease your negative behaviors while improving upon your relationship with your child. This can help to curb behavioral problems in a child. PCIT is a specialized 15-20 session treatment program designed for parents or caregivers and their children aged 10 or younger who may be experiencing behavioral and/or emotional issues. Sessions are an hour long and are done weekly.</p>
<h2>Helps Children Manage Aggressive and Defiant Behaviors</h2>
<p>Parent-child interaction counseling helps target a wide range of <a href="http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/aggression/according-experts/effective-daycare-kindergarten-interventions-prevent-chronic-aggression">aggressive</a> and defiant behaviors in children. Some of those behaviors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swearing</li>
<li>Fighting</li>
<li>Temper tantrums</li>
<li>Refusal to obey rules</li>
<li>Arguing</li>
<li>Low self-esteem</li>
<li>Low frustration threshold</li>
<li>Lying</li>
<li>Blaming others for one&#8217;s actions</li>
</ul>
<p>With such a wide array of behaviors, you may be wondering how this type of counseling can help to solve all of these problems. In order to properly solve behavioral issues, you have to get to the root of the issue with the child. Most of the time, the behavior is one that is learned from the parent and the parent may inadvertently be doing so. For example, when you discipline your child, and they talk back, you may engage with them and argue. If you let them get away with this a couple of times, the habit is formed and it is hard to break without outside assistance. Learning how to break some of these bad habits, and learning techniques to follow yourself when you feel frustrated, will help your child see how to behave in situations. Over time, they will learn by your positive example.</p>
<div class="su-quote su-quote-style-default su-quote-has-cite"><div class="su-quote-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim">Research has shown that, as a result of PCIT, parents learn more effective parenting techniques, the behavior problem of children decrease, and the quality of the parent-child relationship improves.<span class="su-quote-cite">(U.S. Department of Human and Health Services, 2015)</span></div></div>
<h2>Helps Improve Parent-Child Relationships</h2>
<p>One of the biggest benefits to parent-child interaction therapy is that you can improve upon your relationship with your child. Many parents would love a better relationship with their child, but they simply don&#8217;t know how. This type of program teaches you how to communicate with and respect your child, while still asserting your parental position. Creating and establishing a positive relationship is much easier in younger children, so the earlier you start, the better.</p>
<h2>Helps Reduce Child Abuse</h2>
<p>The last benefit to parent-child interaction therapy is that it helps to <a href="http://encompassnw.org/parent-child-interaction-therapy-decreases-tension-and-improves-relationships/">reduce child abuse</a>. When parents are frustrated, they can say things that can be hurtful and emotionally abusive to a child. Unfortunately, they may not even realize because that&#8217;s how they were disciplined as a child. PCIT breaks the cycle of abuse and teaches you how to parent without emotionally or physically abusing your child.</p>

According to the National Institute of Health (NIH) Over <a title="Mental Illness- National Institute of Mental Health" href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20there%20were%20an,20.6%25%20of%20all%20U.S.%20adults." target="_blank" rel="noopener">20% of adults</a> in the country have a mental illness, but only around 45% of those receive behavioral healthcare (2019). The lack of local access to mental health services, cost of treatment, societal stigma, and other factors contribute to the widespread inability to get treatment. Telehealthcare removes obstacles to receiving mental health care. Virtual therapy sessions are enabling more and more people with mental health issues to succeed in their lives.</p>
<p><span id="more-5931"></span></p>
<h2>Suffering Without Mental Health Treatment</h2>
<p>People with untreated mental illness often suffer from social isolation, loss of key relationships, and difficulty maintaining employment. In addition to their loss of human connections, there are numerous potential <a title="Dual Diagnosis Treatment for Co-Occurring Disorders in Utah - Pathways Residential Inpatient Treatment Services in Glenwood, Utah - Residential Rehab Treatment in Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/dual-diagnosis-treatment-co-occuring-disorders-utah/">comorbidities with mental illness</a>. These can include sleep disorders, depression, <a title="Customized Addiction Treatment Programs Available- We Accept Most Insurance Plans and Offer Financing Options" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/programs/">drug or alcohol addiction</a>, heart disease, gastrointestinal problems, obesity, and others.</p>
<h2>How Can Telemedicine Support Mental Health?</h2>
<h3>More Available Therapists</h3>
<p>Using telemedicine to deliver <a title="Behavioral Health Treatment Services- Anxiety, Depression, Grief, Trauma, Abuse, Marriage, Family, And Addiction Issues" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/mental-health-services/">mental health care</a> can help reduce the current shortage of mental health treatment providers. From licensed therapists to psychiatrists, mental health care specialists’ availability is decreasing throughout the country. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services research predicts that there will be an increasing shortage of mental health care providers over the coming years. The DHHS predicts that shortages will become severe in multiple areas of services by 2025. With the ability to provide care by telehealth appointment, healthcare professionals can more effectively maximize availability.</p>
<h3>Ease of Treatment Access</h3>
<p>Meeting with the therapist remotely, instead of being required to drive to the medical office eliminates the burden of commuting to therapy. This can enable busy parents, rural patients, overworked professionals, small business sole proprietors, handicapped patients, elderly people, patients without vehicles, and others to attend therapy.</p>
<h3>More Cost-Efficient Treatment</h3>
<p>Virtual care can be expected to be more cost-effective for providers and patients. Paying for teletherapy, vs. treatment at a medical office or emergency room can be more affordable for uninsured patients and those who have exceeded their maximum insurance benefits for mental health care. Plus, transportation, child care, lost work, and other costs for treatment are eliminated.</p>
<h3>More Consistent Treatment</h3>
<p>For many people who need mental health treatment, their personal circumstances are unstable, leading to disruptions of their mental health care routines. For example, they may struggle with job losses, financial distress, eviction, unexpected relocation, broken primary relationships, and other shocks to their mental health care routine. With virtual treatment sessions, the patient can more easily continue with a therapist, even when their personal circumstances change.</p>
<h3>Less Stressful to Dual-Diagnosed Patients</h3>
<p>People with comorbidities account for a staggering 70% of all patients of behavioral healthcare providers. Patients requiring multiple forms of medical treatment like addiction and combined therapies are met with special challenges. They must cope with multiple health conditions simultaneously and meet more intensive attendance demands if they want to receive all the treatment they need. Virtual treatment sessions make it possible for them to receive more therapy with less physically demanding attendance.</p>
<h3>Helps Therapists Develop Deeper Insights</h3>
<p>Mental healthcare providers can naturally develop deeper insights into patients’ problems and solutions when they can meet with them virtually in their homes. Spending time in the patient’s personal environment allows the <a title="Tips to Choosing a Therapist in Utah Who’s a Good Match for You" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/choosing-a-therapist-in-utah-whos-a-good-match-for-you/">therapist</a> to observe their habits of self-care, their living environment, family dynamics, and other helpful diagnostic and treatment information.</p>
<h3>Ease of Professional Collaboration</h3>
<p>Telecom innovations have made collaboration between mental healthcare providers and relevant specialists much more accessible, for more robust programs of ongoing engagement. This means care providers are no longer relatively isolated from others during treatment. They can now work with other clinicians via virtual sessions, to deliver comprehensive treatment. This approach can reduce the need for hospitalization and enable care providers to manage mental illness, stabilize patients and help prevent escalation of crises that lead to inpatient admissions.</p>
<h3>More Conducive to Patient Bonding</h3>
<p>Receiving mental health care inside the comforting surroundings of their own home can help many patients feel more secure and less apprehensive and self-protective. It can allow them to feel freer to connect at a deeper level of trust and be more open to productive teamwork with their mental health care providers.</p>
<h3>Alleviates Worries About Stigma</h3>
<p>Receiving therapy via telemedicine technology helps reduce the fear of the stigma of mental illness that is common for people with anxiety about being discovered entering a mental health treatment center. That fear causes many patients to avoid seeking the care they need. Telemedicine allows them to utilize mental health services privately, in their own home.</p>
<h3>Enables Remote Addiction Treatment</h3>
<p>Telemedicine is proving effective in providing broader treatment for people afflicted with opioids, methamphetamine, alcohol, and other addictions. Drug and alcohol addiction have become vast national crises in the United States. The problems are as rampant in rural areas as in urban neighborhoods, but the majority of addiction treatment facilities are in or near cities. Treatment sessions via virtual meeting technology can enable people to receive addiction treatment wherever they live.</p>
<h3>Makes Treatment More Affordable</h3>
<p>For women with children, allocating funds for childcare in order to attend therapy is cost-prohibitive. For students and other young people struggling with severely limited finances, senior citizens on a fixed income, and low-income patients, telemedicine makes therapy affordable for more people.</p>
<h2>The Telemedical Mental Health Treatment Solution</h2>
<p>The U.S. healthcare system has been challenged for a long time to meet the country’s ever-increasing needs for access to behavioral healthcare. In fact, insufficient access to mental health treatment has become a serious deficiency in the overall healthcare system over the past decade.</p>
<p>Naturally, telehealth services cannot be expected to resolve all treatment issues for all patients who need help with issues of mental illness. However, advanced technology can accomplish an extraordinary amount of improvement in the system, by helping people connect to the essential <a title="Get Started on Your Pathway to Recovery!- Fill Up This Online Form" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/online-forms/">mental health resources</a> for living healthier lives.</p>

There are typical obstacles that dishearten many people suffering from alcohol or drug addiction, causing them to <a title="Steps to Take if Your Loved One Is Unwilling to Seek Help" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/what-to-do-if-an-addict-is-unwilling-to-seek-help/">avoid seeking treatment</a> or doubt their likelihood of lasting success after rehab. In some cases, individuals face a combination of these barriers to entering a substance abuse program. But, every individual who needs alcohol or drug addiction treatment should be able and willing to receive it.</p>
<p>Although some people succeed in turning away from abusing drugs or alcohol with just support from friends or family, there are over 20 million individuals struggling with addiction in the United States who need treatment in a substance abuse center in order to overcome their dependency. In those cases, their addiction may be too extreme, or they may have a strong genetic predisposition, or there may be mental health factors or other issues which require help from rehab professionals.<br />
<span id="more-5909"></span></p>
<h2>Why Don’t People Who Need Rehab Seek Treatment?</h2>
<p>It can be extremely difficult for some people to face the prospect of starting drug or <a title="Why Choose Pathways?- Best Substance Abuse Treatment Program in Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/why-pathways/">alcohol rehabilitation treatments</a>. Some have severe cravings or even withdrawal symptoms that can intimidate them from facing the process of overcoming their addiction. Others may try to hide their addiction, because of the stigma it bears in their community around them. These are just a few of the many reasons why people avoid starting treatment.</p>
<p>The voluminous report of the <em><a title="National Survey on Drug Use and Health- SAMHSA, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality" href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/NSDUH-DetTabs2014/NSDUH-DetTabs2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health</a></em>, from DHHS’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), offers data on reasons why people do not seek treatment for substance addiction (2011-2014). The research found that among the most frequent reasons people in need of rehab treatment did not seek help included:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>8% said they believe they can quit using on their own.</em></li>
<li><em>39% did not think they could afford to go to rehab.</em></li>
<li><em>17% feared being in rehab would impact their jobs.</em></li>
<li><em>18% wanted to avoid the stigma of admitting addiction.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Overcoming Barriers To Addiction Treatment</h2>
<p>In some cases, people don’t seek addiction treatment for a combination of reasons. They may believe they can’t afford treatment. Or, they might be too fearful of telling their employer they need to go into rehab. Maybe they’re worried about being absent from work, or a lack of childcare or they may feel unable to get help due to any one of many other concerns. Here are just a few of the most common examples of concerns people have about seeking treatment for substance abuse:</p>
<h3>They Don’t Believe They Have a Serious Problem</h3>
<p>Over a third of people with substance addiction believe they’re not addicted or that they can stop using drugs or alcohol whenever they want to, without help. They often don’t see the harm their behavior is causing to their important relationships, their employment, and other areas of their lives.</p>
<p>Recognizing their need for substance abuse treatment is the necessary awakening that enables them to turn toward a new life beyond addiction, starting with getting the help they need to free themselves from substance abuse and move on to a more fulfilling life.</p>
<h3>They Believe Rehab Costs Too Much</h3>
<p>Many people struggling with addiction don’t think they can afford rehab. Generally, drug addiction rehabilitation experts recommend a minimum of 90 days<a title="Pathways Residential Inpatient Rehab Center for Drug &#038; Alcohol Addiction" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/inpatient-drug-and-alcohol-rehab/"> inpatient treatment</a> in cases of severe substance addiction.</p>
<p>The good news is that these days many drug treatment centers base the cost of rehab on a person’s income. Some drug and alcohol rehab facilities also receive government funding, enabling them to reduce the cost of treatment for people seeking rehab.</p>
<h3>They Can’t Leave Their Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Over 75% of people with drug or alcohol addiction in the United States are afraid they will lose their jobs while they’re away in rehab. Sufficient time in rehab means a greater likelihood of <a title="General Outpatient Program Utah- We Accept Most Insurance Plans and Offer Financing Options" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/general-outpatient-program/">long-term recovery success</a> and less risk of relapse.</p>
<p>Fortunately, many employers today are supportive of their employees’ decision to obtain treatment for addiction and welcome them back to their jobs after they complete inpatient rehab. Alternatively, <a title="Intensive Outpatient Program Utah- Customized Addiction Treatment Plans Available" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/outpatient-recovery/">outpatient addiction treatment</a> is an effective option for many people, and it makes it possible for them to avoid missing time on their jobs.</p>
<h3>They Don’t Have Sufficient Childcare Resources</h3>
<p>A serious issue for many individuals coping with addiction is the absence of adequate child care options. It can be a very tough decision to entrust the care of one’s child to another person. But, the choice to recover from addiction is the most important thing a parent can do for their child and herself or himself, making it the right decision in every case of substance addiction.</p>
<p>After all, the alternative is potentially allowing alcohol or drug addiction to cause job loss and loss of child custody. Recovering from addiction is the most practical way to avoid those outcomes and do your best for your child.</p>
<h3>They’re Worried About the Stigma of Addiction and Rehab</h3>
<p>Nearly 20% of individuals who do not seek addiction treatment say their worried about their reputation. They fear what their spouse, family, neighbors, coworkers, employers, and others in their community will think of them if they go into drug or alcohol rehab. They naturally fear social judgment, because addiction is stigmatized in the U.S. However, contrary to their fears, the majority of families and friends want their loved ones to recover from addiction and not go on suffering with it.</p>
<h3>There Is No Treatment Program in Their Area</h3>
<p>A serious obstacle to treatment for substance addiction is often the lack of treatment options. The need for rehab is accelerating more rapidly than new treatment facilities are opening throughout the country. In cities, rehab facilities often have lengthy waiting lists for admission, and in <a title="Alcohol and Drug Rehab Treatment Center Service Areas" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/alcohol-and-drug-rehab-treatment-center-service-areas/">rural areas</a>, people seeking addiction treatment are sometimes forced to travel many miles for treatment.</p>
<p>There are some effective alternatives, including seeking help from a person’s family doctor. They can attend support groups, and they can start in AA or Narcotics Anonymous while waiting to begin rehab.</p>

<h2>Asking for the Help You Need Is the Smart Choice</h2>
<p>There are countless reasons for not seeking treatment for substance addiction, but you don’t need to wait until things are much worse before you reach out and ask for the help you need. Addiction treatment and relapse prevention are more likely to be easier and more effective long-term when individuals seek the help they need before their addiction grows more severe.</p>

Unfortunately, opiate addiction is incredibly common. In a lot of situations, this addiction takes root following prescription medications. Opioid and narcotic drugs are only supposed to be used for short-term conditions. <em><strong>Unfortunately, many people end up relying on them to control chronic pain for prolonged amounts of time. Eventually, people get addicted to them.</strong></em> People may progress from prescription opioid medications to substances that are more deadly. Sadly, opioid overdoses are incredibly common. Why is this the case? What makes them different from other medications?<br />
<span id="more-5869"></span></p>
<h2>People Develop a Tolerance To Opioid Medications Over Time</h2>
<p>If individuals take opioids for a prolonged amount of time, they develop a tolerance to them. Opioid medications function by traveling throughout the body. Then, they bind to specific receptors scattered throughout various systems. Some of the most common locations in which these receptors are found include the spinal cord, the peripheral neurons, and the brain. After an opioid binds to this receptor, the body responds appropriately. For example, opioids may numb people&#8217;s response to pain.</p>
<p>Over time, these receptors are going to change both in how they function and how many of them there are. This is how people develop a tolerance to opioid medications. If people develop a tolerance to opioids, they will have to take more of that specific medication to achieve the same effects. This is called tolerance.</p>
<h2>Tolerance Leads To Opioid Overdoses, Which Can Be Deadly</h2>
<p>There are many reasons people take opioid medications; however, regardless of the reason, opioid addiction can be to tolerance. In individuals who have developed a tolerance to opioid medications, their pain may start to get worse. As a result, they start taking more and more opioids to achieve the same effect.</p>
<p>As people take higher doses of opioids, the chances of overdosing start to go up. Unfortunately, opioid overdoses can be deadly. Opioid medications work in the central nervous system. When people overdose on opioids, this can lead to something called respiratory depression. As a result, people may fall asleep, go unconscious, and they&#8217;re breathing may start to slow. Opioid overdoses cause someone to take low, shallow breaths. This deprives the heart, the brain, and other vital organs of oxygen, which can be fatal. As a result, anyone who has developed a physical dependence on opioid medications should seek the help of trained professionals.</p>
<h2>What Are the Symptoms of Opioid Abuse and Addiction?</h2>
<p>Here are some of the signs and symptoms of opioid misuse and addiction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased resistance for the drug</li>
<li>An inability to quit or minimize usage</li>
<li>withdrawal symptoms when you stop using</li>
<li>a desire to keep using even when health complications</li>
<li>an impact on the quality of life, including relationships and employment</li>
<li>spending excess time and money on drugs</li>
<li>extreme sleeping or excessive weight loss or gain</li>
<li>turning to crime to pay for more opiates</li>
</ul>

In the past, there was a significant stigma that surrounded addiction and substance abuse. Thankfully, the stigma has started to lift. As a result, more resources have been poured into helping those who struggle with addiction and substance abuse. One option that is available now is residential rehab. First, you need to understand the basics of <a title="Inpatient Rehab- Why Choose Residential Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Centre?- Pathway Real Life Recovery, Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/inpatient-drug-and-alcohol-rehab">residential drug and alcohol rehab</a> and residential rehab centers’ benefits.</p>
<p><span id="more-5822"></span></p>
<h2>What Is Residential Drug and Alcohol Rehab?</h2>
<p>When discussing <a title="Women's Recovery Rehab- Why Choose Residential Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Centre?- Pathway Real Life Recovery, Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/womens-recovery-residence/">residential drug and alcohol rehab</a>, it is essential for everyone to know that this program completely consumes someone’s schedule, 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Even though it sounds daunting, <em><strong>this environment is essential for helping someone attain sobriety and learn the tools to be sober in the future.</strong></em></p>
<p>Also called inpatient treatment, when someone enters <a title="Men's Residential Rehab- Why Choose Residential Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Centre?- Pathway Real Life Recovery, Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/residential-recovery-for-men/">residential drug and alcohol treatment programs</a>, they will stay there for anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. There, they will receive the treatment they need to navigate the road to recovery successfully once they transition to the outpatient world.</p>
<h2>What Happens at Residential Rehab?</h2>
<p>In residential rehab, there are several ways the treatment might unfold. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many people who attend residential rehab will receive individual counseling from a <a title="Our Team- Why Choose Residential Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Centre?- Pathway Real Life Recovery, Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/our-team/">psychiatrist or therapist.</a></li>
<li>There will also be <a title="Group Therapy- Why Choose Residential Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Centre?- Pathway Real Life Recovery, Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/group-therapy/">group programs</a> that take place so that attendees can learn from others’ experiences.</li>

</ul>
<p>Furthermore, it is essential to note that many inpatient centers double as <a title="Detox Centre- Why Choose Residential Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Centre?- Pathway Real Life Recovery, Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/detox-center-utah/">detox centers</a>, allowing individuals to go through withdrawal syndromes under a trained medical professional’s supervision.</p>
<h2>What Are the Benefits of Residential Rehabilitation Centres</h2>
<p>Several benefits come with relying on residential rehabilitation centers for drug and alcohol treatment. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a firm structure in place that allows every individual to focus on getting healthy, eliminating the time that would otherwise enable cravings to fester.</li>
<li>There is a sense of community, helping prevent people from suffering from drug abuse from feeling isolated or guilty.</li>
<li>There is a singular focus on getting better, allowing individuals to eliminate distractions and focus on their health.</li>

<h2><b>Here is some advice for choosing a therapist in Utah who&#8217;s a good match for your needs.</b></h2>
<h3>Potential Therapists &amp; Programs for Veterans</h3>
<p>You probably wouldn&#8217;t run to the first dentist you find in the phone book and simply let him start drilling your teeth without first doing some research. Why should searching for a therapist be any different? Look at the different therapists in Utah and check for <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/client-testimonials/" title="Read Testimonials for Pathways Real Life Recovery in Utah - Choosing a Therapist Who's a Good Match - Recovery Center Utah">testimonials from past clients</a>. Did other people have success in working with a particular therapist or program to overcome their addictions? Thoroughly vet and research therapists as you would any other professional service.</p>
<h3>Look for Training &#038; Experience</h3>
<p>There are many different types of therapists in Utah, so you want to select one who specializes in your needed area. Do the therapists you are considering have training and experience in working with people your age? If you are struggling with addiction, you want a therapist who understands the recovery process, for example.</p>
<h3>Request an Initial Consultation</h3>
<p>When you first meet a new person, you can often tell right away whether you like them or not. It&#8217;s the same way with a therapist. If you have the opportunity to meet with a potential <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/contact/" title="Contact Pathways Real Life Recovery in Utah - Choosing a Therapist Who's a Good Match - Recovery Center Utah">therapist for a free consultation</a>, you can get a sense of whether there can be a bond of trust and professionalism to help you on your journey. This is a great opportunity to continue the vetting process because you can ask a therapist about their treatment philosophy, success rates, and other important factors. After the consultation, ask yourself whether you felt able to trust and communicate honestly with that therapist.</p>
<h3>Check Your Therapist Documentation</h3>
<p>Research the background of a therapist or clinic before committing to seek treatment with them. Are they licensed with the Utah Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing? If they are a medical doctor as well as a therapist, is their license in good standing? You can also research a clinic&#8217;s standing in the community to get a feel for how they do business. Do they have a good reputation overall? Also, do they accept <a href="/network-providers/" title="View a list of Network providers accepted at Pathways Real Life Recovery - Choosing a Therapist Who's a Good Match - Recovery Center Utah">medical insurance</a> or financing to help pay for your treatment?</p>
<h3>Know When to Tough It Out &#038; When to Switch Therapists</h3>
<p>You may have finally settled on a therapist, only to decide later that you need a new therapist. Is this really the case? It&#8217;s perfectly fine to switch and move on to a new therapist if you genuinely are not working well with them. But for the best chance of success, don&#8217;t move on to a new therapist just because the process is difficult. If you make a switch, do it for the right reason.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='3 Ways to Manage Your Mental Wellness During the Holidays' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/3-ways-to-manage-your-mental-wellness-during-the-holidays/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p class="ffb-id-pk3copb fg-paragraph text-left    fg-text-dark"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Holiday season is the best time to spend time with friends and family. But for many people, this time can bring or worsen anxiety, depression, and stress. This can be caused by many factors which may include increased financial burden as a result of travel, gifts and hotel charges. You may also be overwhelmed since the holiday season includes lots of parties, traveling, and performances which are difficult to balance with everyday self-care and responsibilities. </span><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Pathways Real Life Recovery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> offers mental health counseling services in Sandy, Utah. </span><b><i>If you experience one of the above challenges, the following are tips that you can use to manage your increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression during your holiday</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-5077"></span></p>
<h2>1. Improve Your Physical Health</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can introduce some form of regular exercise during the holiday. </span><b><i>Exercise strengthens the lungs and heart and also releases dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and endorphins that have an energizing effect and lift our mood</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. The effects of exercise are felt instantly, unlike medication which can take several weeks to kick in. Exercise also contributes to a more positive body image, which can be helpful for those wishing to increase their self-esteem and self-confidence.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>2. Build Your Resilience</strong><br />
</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You should build your emotional resilience to cope with ups and downs during a holiday. </span><b><i>Resilience is our ability to maintain or recover good feeling about ourselves, independent of the environment we may find ourselves in</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Emotional resilience can be achieved in many ways, but the most crucial is by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Talking to someone,</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> e.g., to a friend, family member or a counselor, because communication releases tension that may build up inside.</span></li>
<li><b>Improving your self-esteem &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> this is particularly important since many situations in our lives, such as relationship break-ups, not getting the job we want, can dramatically lower our self-esteem. People wishing to improve their self-esteem must treat themselves in a positive but honest way.</span></li>
<li><b>Managing your stress levels &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> reduce your working hours, ask for help, get some regular &#8216;me-time&#8217; when you can completely relax and unwind by developing good relationships with your friends, family or your partner.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Take Care of Yourself</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Paying attention to your own feeling and needs is essential. </span><b><i>You must try to achieve a balance between what you enjoy and your daily responsibilities, in order to prevent a build-up of stress and negative emotions</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Consider learning and discovering new things. Research has proved that by simply walking a small distance when on holiday can reduce stress and blood pressure naturally. Finally, </span><b><i>avoid drugs and alcohol to cope</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">.

While gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer and trans identity individuals are finding increased mainstream support and acceptance, as many as 65% commonly face anti-LGBTQ harassment and discrimination.</p>
<p><span id="more-5065"></span></p>
<p><strong><em>The effects of discrimination contribute to an alarmingly high rate of <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/drug-rehab-sandy-utah/">substance abuse</a>, <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/depression-treatment-utah/">depression</a>, and <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/utah-suicide-prevention/">suicide</a> among LGBTQ individuals.</em></strong> A staggering 40% of those who identify as transgender has reported attempting suicide. But as shocking as these statistics are, the future is becoming less bleak every day. <strong><em>Emerging mental health resources for LGBTQ people are becoming more attainable thanks to the tireless work of LGBTQ activists and increasing support of allies</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Your active support is critical for the mental wellness of your LGBTQ loved one. <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/"><strong>Pathways Real Life Recovery Center in Utah</strong></a> understands that<strong><em> acceptance from loved ones and active family support play a particularly important role to prevent suicide</em></strong>. Be a part of the solution and lend your support by becoming an LGBTQ ally. Here are 5 ways to support the <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/lgbtq-counselor-in-utah/">mental health of your LGBTQ loved ones</a>:</p>
<h2><strong>1. Stand Up for Your Loved One!</strong></h2>
<p>Becoming a true ally can make a big difference in the daily life of your LGBTQ loved one. Life is challenging for all of us, but LGBTQ people often face anti-LGBTQ words and actions that create difficult barriers even in seemingly simple circumstances. As allies, it is our job to <strong><em>stand up for our LGBTQ loved ones by calling out anti-LGBTQ behavior</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Educate other family members about acceptance by explaining LGBTQ identities and openly answering questions. Show your support at work by having your LGBTQ co-worker&#8217;s back and always call out discrimination. You can also <strong><em>make a difference by advocating for company or policy changes that will encourage acceptance and understanding</em></strong> like diversity training.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Respect Their Chosen Identity</strong></h2>
<p>Affirm the love and support for the LGBTQ people in your life by respecting how they choose to live their lives, who they choose to love and how they choose to be identified. <strong><em>Embrace their individual self-expression and stay away from pressuring them to conform.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Always use an individual&#8217;s personally chosen gender pronouns and encourage or correct others to do the same.</em></strong> Research shows that the risk of suicide is reduced for transgender youth whose communities affirm their chosen identities.</p>
<h2><strong>3. NEVER &#8216;Out&#8217; Your LGBTQ Loved One</strong></h2>
<p>Coming out isn&#8217;t just revealing sexual orientation or gender identity. For most people, coming out is a long and difficult process. Each individual will face different life circumstances that greatly influence their coming out experience. <strong><em>Another person should never assume that they understand the contributing factors of such a challenging and life-changing moment.</em></strong></p>
<p>While there is nothing shameful about being LGBTQ, openly expressing it &#8211; or not &#8211; is a highly personal choice. An individual has the right to facilitate their own terms about their identity and how open they wish to be, even if that differs greatly from one situation to the next. <strong><em>Make sure your LGBTQ loved one knows that you support their choices of expression and how they choose to share them.</em></strong></p>
<h2><strong>4. Confront Your Own Biases</strong></h2>
<p>You love and support your LGBTQ family and friends. But whether you are aware of it or not, <strong><em>we all have involuntary implicit biases that can cause us to react in a discriminatory manner</em></strong>. This unconscious discrimination has deep-seated influences that no one is immune to like gender, religion, and class.</p>
<p>While it is okay to make mistakes, it is important to acknowledge and confront implicit biases in ourselves in order to better support our LGBTQ loved ones. <strong><em>Recognizing our own assumptions about gender, family, love, sex, and intimacy will help us confront biases that normally would never even surface. </em></strong></p>
<p>Work on yourself to <strong><em>adjust the way you unconsciously think and feel to match your current level of love and understanding</em></strong> to be your LGBTQ loved one&#8217;s best ally!</p>
<h2><strong>5. Support and Help Them Access Mental Health Resources</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Support the mental health of your LGBTQ loved ones by being a good listener and making sure they know that you are there for them.</em></strong> You can help them find local resources for <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/our-services/">therapy and substance abuse treatment</a>, an <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/lgbtq-counselor-in-utah/">LGBTQ-friendly therapist</a> and make sure they know about the <strong><a href="https://www.glbthotline.org/national-hotline.html">LGBTQ National Help Center hotline</a>, 1-888-843-4564 </strong>to instantly connect with someone who cares.</p>

The day was set aside to <strong><em>raise awareness of drug overdose and reduce the stigma</em></strong> that is associated with such incidences of overdosing. The overdose awareness day is also celebrated to <strong><em>acknowledge the grief that is felt by numerous families and friends globally who gather to remember their loved ones</em></strong>. International Overdose Awareness Day seeks to spread the message that the tragedy of overdose death is preventable and participants are encouraged to wear a <a href="https://www.overdoseday.com/shop/">silver badge or wristband</a> to show their support for overdose awareness.</p>
<p>Statistics indicate that they were approximately 200,000 drug-related deaths in 2016. The United States alone accounts for more than 25 percent of the estimated number of drug-related deaths worldwide. In fact, the number of drug overdose-related cases in the United States has tripled between 2000 and 2017 with more than 55,000 people dying from fatal drug overdoses every year.</p>
<h2>Drug Overdose Is a Global Problem</h2>
<p><span id="more-4914"></span></p>
<p>Drug overdose is an increasing international problem that medical experts are worried about. According to a report by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drug overdose is among the leading cause of drug-related deaths in the U.S. <strong><em>A majority of the drug overdose deaths happen as a result of opioid abuse</em></strong>. The term opioid refer to a class of drugs that has<strong><em> both legal and illegal substances</em></strong>. Most people use prescribed opioids that slow down the central nervous system to produce a calming effect.</p>
<p><strong><em>Opioids are mostly prescribed to reduce pain, but most people end up taking the drug for recreational purposes which </em></strong><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/prescription-drug-abuse-treatment-utah/"><strong><em>leads to addiction</em></strong></a>. When taken in large quantities, opioids can depress certain functions such as normal breathing and heartbeat until they eventually stop leading to death.</p>
<h2>Symptoms of Overdose</h2>
<p>Medical practitioners define drug overdose as the intentional or accidental use of a particular drug or substance such as alcohol beyond the recommended dosage. <strong><em>A drug overdose can have severe consequences with its effects ranging from brain injury, disorientation to seizures and death.</em></strong></p>
<p>Part of the overdose awareness day agenda is to facilitate spread of information on <strong><em>how to identify signs and symptoms</em></strong> of substance abuse and overdose and <strong><em>what you can do to help </em></strong>the affected individuals. The typical signs of drug overdose include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pinpoint pupils</li>
<li>Shallow breathing or breathing that has completely stopped</li>
<li>Gray/blue lips or fingertips</li>
<li>Agitation</li>
<li>Vomiting</li>
<li>No response to stimuli</li>
<li>Unusual snoring</li>
<li>Disorientation</li>
<li>Inability to rouse</li>
</ul>

As a child develops, it may get difficult for parents to know their feelings and thoughts. Adolescence has its high and low moments. However, a parent may not know when a <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/teen-depression-treatment-utah/">teen is depressed</a>. <em><strong>It&#8217;s essential to learn the possible factors that could cause severe depression to your kid that they <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/utah-suicide-prevention/">contemplate committing suicide</a></strong></em>.<br />
<strong>Here are some tips on how you could avert your child&#8217;s thoughts from suicide:</strong></p>
<h2><strong>1. Avoid Ignoring Suicide Threats</strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>Do not underestimate</strong></em> early suicidal signs. <em><strong><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/connections-between-mental-health-and-substance-abuse/">Teens may indulge in substance abuse</a> or merely isolate themselves</strong></em> from other family members. At times, the teenager issues <em><strong>verbal or written statements</strong></em> declaring their intentions to commit suicide. As a parent, you should <strong>take them seriously</strong>.</p>
<p>Often, kids mulling over suicide <em><strong>repeatedly inform</strong></em> their guardians and parents about it. Scientific studies reveal that such people <em><strong>don&#8217;t intend</strong></em> to kill themselves. Instead, the threats are usually a <strong>plea for urgent help and attention</strong>.</p>
<p>When your child starts issuing death threats, try to keep cool. Avoid displaying shock or scolding them. Spare some time to tentatively <em><strong>listen to your their concerns as you reassure them of your love and commitment</strong></em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-4819"></span></p>
<h2><strong>2. Consult a Certified Counselor</strong></h2>
<p>Promptly visit a pediatrician if your child&#8217;s strange behavior persists for a while. Alternatively, you can contact a nearby mental health specialist for her to evaluate your teen. He should start attending therapy sessions soon afterward if he is prone to self-harm.</p>
<p>You should also contact your psychological support team and mobilize it at a nearby emergency room. It&#8217;s essential to <em><strong>seek help right away</strong></em> if your kid is actively suicidal or if he intends to harm himself.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Control Your Child&#8217;s Anxiety</strong></h2>
<p>A child could have had a bad day. He should brighten up after a while. However, if his dampen spirit lasts for several days, you should get concerned. It&#8217;s proven that <em><strong>over 80% of American teens who commit suicide were once diagnosed with a mental disorder</strong></em>. <em>Most of them displayed intense anxiety and <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/teen-depression-treatment-utah/">depression</a>.</em></p>
<p>In most instances, depressed people become antisocial. However, they yearn to get <em><strong>rescued</strong></em> from their tabulations. They are <em><strong>often embarrassed</strong></em> to display their moodiness to loved ones. Its <em><strong>prevalent in boys</strong></em> as the society expects them to conceal their emotions.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Try to Figure Out Your Child&#8217;s Thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>Most teenagers who plan to commit suicide display strange actions and characters. Research has shown that in most families affected by teenage suicide have <em><strong>poor communications between parents and children</strong></em>.</p>
<p>However, other factors could lead to teen suicide. These include <em><strong>breakups, drug abuse, peer pressure, humiliation, impulsiveness and a severe medical condition</strong></em>. If your instinct cautions you that your kid wants to harm himself, take prudent measures. You need to learn how to <em><strong>communicate</strong></em> with and <em><strong>listen</strong></em> to your teen efficiently.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Express Your Feelings</strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>Assure your teen that you have their back</strong></em>. It&#8217;s normal for anyone to get anxious or depressed once in a while. It also happens in adults. <em><strong>Reassure them that tough times don&#8217;t last forever</strong></em> while avoiding aggravating their condition. It will encourage them to soldier on in life. They will eventually get through the depression after you enroll them in therapy sessions.</p>
<h2><strong>6. Discourage the Child from Isolating Himself</strong></h2>
<p>When facing a desperate situation in life, it isn&#8217;t wise to isolate yourself from other people. However, depressed teens tend to avoid being social. You should encourage your teen to have frequent walks in the neighborhood. It will help in <em><strong>distracting</strong></em> him from his troubles.</p>
<h2><strong>7. Remind Your Child to Be Patient</strong></h2>
<p>Talk therapies typically <em><strong>take time</strong></em> to improve an individual&#8217;s temperament. Your teen shouldn&#8217;t get discouraged in case his state doesn&#8217;t improve immediately. You should train him to be patient when expecting to see <em><strong>long-term life changes</strong></em>. Besides, he should strictly <em><strong>follow</strong></em> the therapy schedule without skipping any session.</p>
<h2><strong>8. Safely Store All Your Firearms</strong></h2>
<p>You should quickly store your weapons before your suicidal child picks it. A report from Brady Centre to Prevent Gun Violence reveals that in 2013, the number of American youth who committed suicide by firearms skyrocketed. It exceeded that of the previous 12 years.

<h2><strong>9. Urge Your Child Not To Pressurize Himself</strong></h2>
<p>Mental therapy takes time for its effects to be visible. Until he starts recuperating, avoid assigning numerous responsibilities to him. Urge him to <em><strong>divide complex tasks into smaller and manageable ones</strong></em>. He should also take part in <em><strong>leisure activities</strong></em>. The aim is to <em><strong>boost his confidence, self-esteem, and self-control</strong></em>.</p>
<h2><strong>10. Encourage Him to Work Out</strong></h2>
<p>Taking part in intense physical activities is essential. Working out <em><strong>stimulates the brain to produce endorphins</strong></em>. It&#8217;s a hormone that is said to <em><strong>enhance moods and relieving pain</strong></em>. Endorphins minimize the amount of cortisol circulating in the body. It is often associated with depression.<br />
A physical exercise distracts an individual from their challenges and enables them to have a higher self-appreciation. Physicians recommend work out sessions lasting up to thirty minutes a day. Your teen should work out three times a week for you to see significant improvement. However, you <em><strong>should select an activity that he enjoys</strong></em>.</p>
