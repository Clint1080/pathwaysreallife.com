										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='3 Ways to Manage Your Mental Wellness During the Holidays' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/3-ways-to-manage-your-mental-wellness-during-the-holidays/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p class="ffb-id-pk3copb fg-paragraph text-left    fg-text-dark"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Holiday season is the best time to spend time with friends and family. But for many people, this time can bring or worsen anxiety, depression, and stress. This can be caused by many factors which may include increased financial burden as a result of travel, gifts and hotel charges. You may also be overwhelmed since the holiday season includes lots of parties, traveling, and performances which are difficult to balance with everyday self-care and responsibilities. </span><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Pathways Real Life Recovery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> offers mental health counseling services in Sandy, Utah. </span><b><i>If you experience one of the above challenges, the following are tips that you can use to manage your increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression during your holiday</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-5077"></span></p>
<h2>1. Improve Your Physical Health</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can introduce some form of regular exercise during the holiday. </span><b><i>Exercise strengthens the lungs and heart and also releases dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and endorphins that have an energizing effect and lift our mood</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. The effects of exercise are felt instantly, unlike medication which can take several weeks to kick in. Exercise also contributes to a more positive body image, which can be helpful for those wishing to increase their self-esteem and self-confidence.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>2. Build Your Resilience</strong><br />
</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You should build your emotional resilience to cope with ups and downs during a holiday. </span><b><i>Resilience is our ability to maintain or recover good feeling about ourselves, independent of the environment we may find ourselves in</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Emotional resilience can be achieved in many ways, but the most crucial is by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Talking to someone,</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> e.g., to a friend, family member or a counselor, because communication releases tension that may build up inside.</span></li>
<li><b>Improving your self-esteem &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> this is particularly important since many situations in our lives, such as relationship break-ups, not getting the job we want, can dramatically lower our self-esteem. People wishing to improve their self-esteem must treat themselves in a positive but honest way.</span></li>
<li><b>Managing your stress levels &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> reduce your working hours, ask for help, get some regular &#8216;me-time&#8217; when you can completely relax and unwind by developing good relationships with your friends, family or your partner.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Take Care of Yourself</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Paying attention to your own feeling and needs is essential. </span><b><i>You must try to achieve a balance between what you enjoy and your daily responsibilities, in order to prevent a build-up of stress and negative emotions</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Consider learning and discovering new things. Research has proved that by simply walking a small distance when on holiday can reduce stress and blood pressure naturally. Finally, </span><b><i>avoid drugs and alcohol to cope</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Even though escaping may sound appealing, drugs and alcohol actually worsen symptoms. </span><b><i>Choosing a well-balanced diet and drinking water over alcohol is guaranteed that you will feel much better, both physically and emotionally</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>

Sometimes the enemy within can be much more dangerous than outside forces. In fact, struggling with negative beliefs about yourself makes it all too easy to lapse into self-destructive patterns. That’s why breaking that no-win cycle of low self-esteem &#8212; and the bad choices related to it &#8212; is the first step to a more peaceful, productive life. Here are a few methods to help you get there.</p>
<h2><strong>Consider the Source               </strong></h2>
<p>A loving family does not inflict harsh judgment on young children, nor do truly responsible teachers and coaches insult impressionable young people. If you were told you were lazy, unintelligent or homely as a child, remind yourself that those characterizations reflect badly on the adult who said them, rather than on you.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: Write a letter to a person from your past who damaged your self-esteem. You don’t have to actually send the letter but focus on describing that person’s unrealistic standards or constant judgment. The act of writing the letter will help you understand how those unfair words shaped you.</p>
<p><span id="more-4772"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Remember That “Comparisons are Odious”</strong></h2>
<p>It’s a centuries-old saying, but one that still resonates today. Comparing your life or personality to the success of a friend or colleague is one of the surest ways to spiral into self-loathing.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment:</strong> Each day, make a note of something positive about yourself. Whether it’s a kindness you did for a co-worker, a new skill you’ve mastered, or even something “vain” like a flattering new hairstyle, it’s important to make note of these good things. Periodically reading this self-positivity journal will help you understand your own self-worth.</p>
<h2><strong>Name Your Unhealthy Beliefs</strong></h2>
<p>It’s one thing to know in general that a bad self-image will bring you down &#8212; and another to identify some specific faults. Once you identify those supposed flaws, you can start to learn how to break that cycle of self-doubt.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: <a title="Changing Core Beliefs, Emotional Reactions and Behaviors - Pathways Real Life Recovery" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/changing-core-beliefs-emotional-reactions-behaviors/">Belief-restructuring therapy </a>can be an essential tool on your road to well-being. Customized treatment sessions help you identify, then address, these core beliefs about yourself that are weighing you down emotionally.</p>
<h2><strong>Interrogate Your Fears</strong></h2>
<p>It seems logical that if we have something we dislike about ourselves, then we’d do anything to change it, right? Yet lurking within many of us is the suspicion that what we don’t like is so intrinsic to our personalities that it can’t be changed &#8212; or that even if we solve or disprove that one trait, even worse ones will be lurking. Therefore, it’s easier to complain about what we don’t like about ourselves, rather than to do something which might fail.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: It may seem silly, but the question “What’s the worst that could happen?” is an essential one to ask. Often, naming your fear makes you realize that it’s either unlikely or easily solved. And if you find that this simple, self-directed exercise isn’t doing the trick, there are other options. <a title="Anxiety Treatment in Utah - Changing Negative Beliefs - Pathways Real Life Recovery" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/anxiety-treatment-utah/">Professional sessions specially designed to treat anxiety</a> are excellent tools in your quest to banish those negative beliefs and their surrounding fears.</p>
<h2><strong>Envision a Brighter Future</strong></h2>
<p>Once you do begin to overcome your fear of failure and explode some of those self-doubting myths, it’s time to expand your horizons. If you’ve always told yourself you weren’t creative, for example, what can you now accomplish, after accepting that you might have an artistic bent after all?</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: Now comes the fun part. Brainstorm ways to catch up on what you’ve been missing all those years when you decreed yourself not good enough for a certain pursuit, be it hobby, career or even romance! Make a list of all you’ve been missing and concrete steps you can take to achieve the goals you once believed you weren’t good enough for.</p>
<h2><strong>A Way Forward</strong></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='5 Tips to Manage Social Anxiety' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/5-tips-manage-social-anxiety/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p>Social anxiety, also called social phobia, is the fear of being around people. A person suffering from social anxiety often has unreasonable or excessive fear of social interactions or situations, and would rather be alone than interact with other people. It arises from the fear of being judged, criticized, or closely watched by others.<em><a href="http://www.adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/social-anxiety-disorder"> It is estimated that social anxiety disorder affects roughly 15 million adults in the U.S</a></em> and is the most common mental illness in the United States. It is as common in men as it is in women but often affects people around the age of 13.</p>
<p><span id="more-4425"></span></p>
<h2><strong>1. Learn the Facts About Social Anxiety Disorder</strong></h2>
<p>Learning the facts about social anxiety can help you realize what is going on with your own body. <strong><em>It is important to note that anxiety is a normal response to danger</em></strong>, so the goal is to learn how to properly manage your anxiety to normal levels that don’t negatively affect your daily life versus eliminating anxiety entirely. Anxiety disorders are treatable, yet only a third of those suffering from the condition seek treatment. Another notable thing is that anxiety disorders develop from very complex risk factors like brain chemistry, genetics, and life events.</p>
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">2. Practice Relaxation Techniques</strong></h2>
<p>Practicing relaxation techniques can help you to remain calm. When we are anxious, we may be tensing our muscles and taking short, shallow breaths that can leave us lightheaded and more anxious.</p>
<p><u>Two common ways to relax when you are anxious are to practice calm breathing and muscle relaxation.</u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calm Breathing</strong> – this technique involves taking deep, slow breaths in through the nose for about four seconds, holding it for a second or two, and then slowly exhaling through the mouth for about four seconds. You will want to wait a few seconds before taking another calming breath, and repeating this process for 6-8 cycles. It is best to practice this while in a sitting position so your lungs can fill with air, and to breath from your abdomen.</li>
<li><strong>Muscle Relaxation</strong> – This is a two-step process that can help you relax by eliminating physical symptoms such as stomachaches and headaches. People with high levels of anxiety are often very tense throughout the day, they may not even realize what it feels like to have relaxed muscles. You will want to find a place you will not be disturbed for about 15 minutes; an ideal place is a reclining arm chair. You do NOT need to wait until you have feelings of anxiety to practice this exercise.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step is to choose a muscle group to target such as your hands; take a big, slow breath, and then tense your muscle group for about five seconds. It is important to really feel the tension in your desired muscle group, and to only tense the target muscle group. After the tension phase comes the relaxation phase. This involves releasing your tensed muscle group as you slowly exhale and the muscles become loose, allowing the tension to flow out. You will want to remain in this relaxed state for approximately fifteen seconds, and then move on to a new muscle group. Repeat this tension-relaxation steps until you have completed all your muscle groups.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Challenge Social Anxiety Gradually</strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>Avoiding social situations actually makes your anxiety worse</strong></em> as you are not allowing yourself to practice your social skills. It is helpful to create an exposure hierarchy where you write down situations that cause anxiety to you. For example, if socializing with strangers makes you anxious, you might start by accompanying an outgoing friend to a party. Once you’re comfortable with that step, you might try introducing yourself to one new person, and so on. Another helpful tip is to ask questions, and let others talk while you listen. Before you know, you will feel more comfortable in social places and situations.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Lifestyle Changes</strong></h2>
<p>A change in lifestyle can also go a long way in keeping social anxiety disorder at bay. While changing your way of life alone cannot help you overcome social anxiety problem, it can support your treatment progress. For instance, it is advisable that you limit or avoid caffeine. <strong>Caffeinated soda, tea, coffee, and energy drinks are known to trigger or increase anxiety symptoms</strong>. On the same note, drink alcohol only in moderation.  You may think that drinking before attending a social event may calm your nerves. The truth is that alcohol actually increases your risk of having an anxiety attack. Another helpful lifestyle change is to get enough sleep. Being well rested will help you stay calm in social places.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Shift Your Way of Thinking</strong></h2>
<p>The way you perceive things around you has a pronounced impact on your social anxiety. Not many people think of worrying as self-programming. The truth is that it is. When you worry so much about upcoming social situations, you are linking anxiety to these events without knowing it. When you finally go to the event itself, you feel anxious because you had programmed yourself to feel this way. Symptoms of anxiety and excitement are almost identical. If you feel revved up and think, &#8220;I&#8217;m getting anxious&#8221;, it creates a destructive spiral. But if you try to focus your attention outward instead of inward, you&#8217;ll feel more prepared and capable. When in social settings, make a mental note of three aspects of the situation you’re in, such as the color of the room or pictures on the wall.</p>
<h3><strong>When to Seek Help for Social Anxiety</strong></h3>
<p>Remember that anxiety is treatable. If your anxiety is affecting your normal way of life, it is imperative that you seek professional help. <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/anxiety-treatment-utah/">Pathways Real Life Recovery in Utah offers anxiety treatment for adolescents and adults alike</a>. Your specific cause of anxiety will determine treatment. For example, if the cause is difficulty in a marriage, the doctor may suggest marital counseling. Withdrawal from a substance of abuse is often addressed with drug-abuse treatment.</p>
<p>With the right approach, social anxiety is treatable. Pathways can help you deal with anxiety to enable you to live the life you want. We offer common anxiety treatments, such as talk therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy among others. Contact us today for free assessment. We also take insurance and are open 24 hours a day.</p>
