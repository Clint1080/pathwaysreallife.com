<p>The practice of mindfulness originated in traditional Buddhist strategies of <em>training one’s own mind</em> to operate healthily and in greater harmony with one’s experience of existential reality. Over the generations, fostering the self-discipline of mindfulness has made its way into various Western therapies, due to its demonstrated physical and <a title="Practicing Mindfulness for Overcoming Obstacles to Substance Abuse Treatment" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/overcoming-obstacles-to-substance-abuse-treatment/">mental health benefits</a>.</p>



<h2 id="What-is">What is Mindfulness?</h2>



<p>Mindfulness is the simple yet challenging mental practice of <em>being aware</em> of your own thoughts in the moment and of your experiences of your world and your engagements with it — without judging them. It’s about <em>responding</em> instead of <em>reacting</em> to the occurrences that present themselves to you through the moments and days of your life. It involves a developed skill in tracking one’s mental activities, emotional feelings, and physical sensations.</p>



<p><em>Some important benefits of exercising mindfulness are:</em></p>

<h2 id="Misconceptions-of">Misconceptions of Mindfulness</h2>



<p>The point of practicing mindfulness is not to reach a <em>blank</em> mental state. On the contrary, it is about being <em>more </em>aware, more fully <em>present</em>. It is about sharpening one’s awareness of moments and thoughts and emotions and sensations. The point is to embrace awareness, not <em>expel</em> awareness from the mind. It is an exercise in curiosity about <em>all</em> that passes through the consciousness, and in freeing the mind from judgement about any of it.</p>



<p>Although <em>mindfulness</em> is a part of various forms of <em>meditation</em>, the two are not the <em>same</em> thing. Meditation is a dedicated activity, planned and executed, whereas mindfulness is best understood as a developed <em>way of thinking about your thoughts and experiences as they are occurring</em>. It’s a practice of observing and accepting one’s own perceptions of reality in everyday life.</p>



<h2 id="Why-Is-Mindfulness-Hard-to">Why Is Mindfulness Hard to Achieve?</h2>



<p>Today’s social and professional atmosphere can seem like immersion in a state of rapid and constant change. The persistent high energy and sense of perpetual rushing can cause a sense of disequilibrium, often leading to anxiety and even consequences of mental and emotional overload. The relentless daily exposure to it all can be a lot to manage <em>and</em> keep a sense of balance, peace, and contentment.</p>



<p>Self-therapeutic focus on building a richer and more objective awareness of one’s self and world (mindfulness), along with cultivating a mindset of <a title="The Neuroscience of Gratitude and How It Affects Anxiety and Grief" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/the-neuroscience-of-gratitude-and-how-it-affects-anxiety-and-grief/">gratitude</a> involves adopting <a title="Rewiring Your Brain to be Happier- Practicing Mindfulness" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/rewiring-your-brain-to-be-happier/">new ways of thinking</a>. Observing our thoughts and ways of processing our experiences require slowing down enough to experience the present more fully.</p>



<p>That can feel awkward for people who have recently come to practicing mindfulness. Like any other skill, it takes <em>practice</em> to master it, and every individual must try some techniques to discover which ones are most effective for him/her. Fortunately, it’s fun to do, so it’s soothing just to keep <em>trying</em> to exercise our own techniques for mindful self-observation.</p>



<p>Even better, there’s no possibility of failure while you’re <em>trying</em> to be mindful. In efforts at mindfulness, trying <em>is</em> succeeding. In other words, to <em>try</em> to focus on being mindful is what it is to <em>be</em> mindful in that moment.</p>



<h2 id="Mindfulness-for-Help-in-Trauma">Mindfulness for Help in Trauma Recovery</h2>



<p>Moving through life at high speed is a manner of coping for many people struggling with the <a title="Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment in Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd-treatment-in-utah/">effects of past trauma</a>. Practicing mindfulness offers an important tool for helping overcome the often long-lasting effects of trauma. Each person can choose a level of practice to imbue daily consciousness with greater mindfulness.</p>



<p>In making the effort toward more mindful living, each person can be anticipated to find and enjoy his/her <em>own</em> level and comfortable pace of the practice. It can be as easy as closing your eyes and or just sitting quietly and intentionally <em>listening to your own thoughts and feelings</em>, without judging them as they flow through you.</p>



<p>Being mindful is being fully <em>present</em> in your environment, being fully <em>aware</em> of your mental, emotional, and physical responses to it, and discovering that you are feeling comfortable with yourself.</p>



<h2 id="Mindfulness-for-Help-in-Relapse">Mindfulness for Help in Relapse Prevention</h2>



<p>Practicing powerful techniques for developing a habit of mindfulness can help people suffering from substance abuse disorder, anxiety, <a title="Treat Severe Depression- Mindfulness is One of The Key" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/its-time-to-change-the-way-we-view-and-treat-severe-depression/">depression</a>, and other <a title="Mental Health Services We Provide at Pathways" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/mental-health-services/">mental health issues</a>.</p>



<p>One vast value of mindfulness is its effectiveness in a person’s efforts toward training his or her own mind to navigate through challenging thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations without reacting to them by practicing unhealthy or even self-destructive behaviors.</p>



<p>An extraordinarily beneficial effect of training one’s own mind to sustain a state of increased mindfulness is a greater ability to detect initial <a title="Mindfulness-Based Drug &amp; Alcohol Relapse Prevention (MBRP)" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/relapse-prevention-utah/">signs of relapse</a> risk by observing your own thoughts, emotions, and physical experience.</p>



<p><em>Practicing</em> <em>awareness</em> of what you are experiencing in these ways can empower you to recognize and respond to early signs of oncoming internal derailing that has led to substance abuse in the past. <em>Using</em> your mindfulness this way can be very powerful in helping sustain addiction recovery. It also enables us to show <em>self-compassion</em> even if relapse occurs. It further helps a person more adeptly bring himself or herself back out of substance abuse <em>sooner</em>, and with even better-developed tools for more lasting success in sobriety going forward.</p>



<h2 id="How-Can-I-Practice">How Can I Practice Mindfulness?</h2>



<p>Practicing mindfulness is a very simple matter of quieting the mind and paying attention to your thoughts as they flow into and out of your mind. It’s just observing your thoughts as they come and go. This is what it is to just <em>be present</em>, also known as to <em>live in the moment</em>. It’s a way to inner balance and greater happiness.</p>



<p>Of course, being <em>simple</em> doesn’t mean it’s <em>easy</em>. It does take practice to eventually find oneself more automatically maintaining an ongoing state of mindfulness. So, practice for a few minutes each day, until you find it becoming a more frequent habit. Strengthen your newly developing habit by continuing to practice it <em>intentionally</em> during times when you find you have drifted out of the mindset.</p>



<p>Continue this process until you find yourself eventually living more continuously in a mindful state. But, mindfulness is naturally an <em>endeavor</em> — with progress for those who continue the practice — not a permanent accomplishment. Take comfort in that fact as you embark on an ever-aspiring life-long journey of gently coaxing your mind into greater extents of mindful awareness.</p>



<h2 id="External-Aids-for-Cultivating">External Aids for Cultivating Mindfulness</h2>



<p>Practicing mindfulness can be challenging in our busy lives and fast-paced environment, but we have the benefit of a great wealth of <a title="Contact Our Experts to Know the Benefits of Mindfulness" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/">resources for cultivating mindfulness</a>. If it helps, you might try attending organized mindfulness group sessions. There are also abundant group meditation opportunities. Or, just walk, sit, lie down, bike, or do something else that helps you free your consciousness to use the activity for focusing your awareness on all the thoughts and sensations you experience while engaged in it.</p>



<p>Modern technologies offer additional resources for developing mindfulness. For example, you can watch online instructional videos and podcasts offering mindfulness guidance. There are even free apps to aid in meditation, and others for developing and practicing mindfulness.</p>

There are typical obstacles that dishearten many people suffering from alcohol or drug addiction, causing them to <a title="Steps to Take if Your Loved One Is Unwilling to Seek Help" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/what-to-do-if-an-addict-is-unwilling-to-seek-help/">avoid seeking treatment</a> or doubt their likelihood of lasting success after rehab. In some cases, individuals face a combination of these barriers to entering a substance abuse program. But, every individual who needs alcohol or drug addiction treatment should be able and willing to receive it.</p>
<p>Although some people succeed in turning away from abusing drugs or alcohol with just support from friends or family, there are over 20 million individuals struggling with addiction in the United States who need treatment in a substance abuse center in order to overcome their dependency. In those cases, their addiction may be too extreme, or they may have a strong genetic predisposition, or there may be mental health factors or other issues which require help from rehab professionals.<br />
<span id="more-5909"></span></p>
<h2>Why Don’t People Who Need Rehab Seek Treatment?</h2>
<p>It can be extremely difficult for some people to face the prospect of starting drug or <a title="Why Choose Pathways?- Best Substance Abuse Treatment Program in Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/why-pathways/">alcohol rehabilitation treatments</a>. Some have severe cravings or even withdrawal symptoms that can intimidate them from facing the process of overcoming their addiction. Others may try to hide their addiction, because of the stigma it bears in their community around them. These are just a few of the many reasons why people avoid starting treatment.</p>
<p>The voluminous report of the <em><a title="National Survey on Drug Use and Health- SAMHSA, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality" href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/NSDUH-DetTabs2014/NSDUH-DetTabs2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health</a></em>, from DHHS’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), offers data on reasons why people do not seek treatment for substance addiction (2011-2014). The research found that among the most frequent reasons people in need of rehab treatment did not seek help included:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>8% said they believe they can quit using on their own.</em></li>
<li><em>39% did not think they could afford to go to rehab.</em></li>
<li><em>17% feared being in rehab would impact their jobs.</em></li>
<li><em>18% wanted to avoid the stigma of admitting addiction.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Overcoming Barriers To Addiction Treatment</h2>
<p>In some cases, people don’t seek addiction treatment for a combination of reasons. They may believe they can’t afford treatment. Or, they might be too fearful of telling their employer they need to go into rehab. Maybe they’re worried about being absent from work, or a lack of childcare or they may feel unable to get help due to any one of many other concerns. Here are just a few of the most common examples of concerns people have about seeking treatment for substance abuse:</p>
<h3>They Don’t Believe They Have a Serious Problem</h3>
<p>Over a third of people with substance addiction believe they’re not addicted or that they can stop using drugs or alcohol whenever they want to, without help. They often don’t see the harm their behavior is causing to their important relationships, their employment, and other areas of their lives.</p>
<p>Recognizing their need for substance abuse treatment is the necessary awakening that enables them to turn toward a new life beyond addiction, starting with getting the help they need to free themselves from substance abuse and move on to a more fulfilling life.</p>
<h3>They Believe Rehab Costs Too Much</h3>
<p>Many people struggling with addiction don’t think they can afford rehab. Generally, drug addiction rehabilitation experts recommend a minimum of 90 days<a title="Pathways Residential Inpatient Rehab Center for Drug &#038; Alcohol Addiction" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/inpatient-drug-and-alcohol-rehab/"> inpatient treatment</a> in cases of severe substance addiction.</p>
<p>The good news is that these days many drug treatment centers base the cost of rehab on a person’s income. Some drug and alcohol rehab facilities also receive government funding, enabling them to reduce the cost of treatment for people seeking rehab.</p>
<h3>They Can’t Leave Their Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Over 75% of people with drug or alcohol addiction in the United States are afraid they will lose their jobs while they’re away in rehab. Sufficient time in rehab means a greater likelihood of <a title="General Outpatient Program Utah- We Accept Most Insurance Plans and Offer Financing Options" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/general-outpatient-program/">long-term recovery success</a> and less risk of relapse.</p>
<p>Fortunately, many employers today are supportive of their employees’ decision to obtain treatment for addiction and welcome them back to their jobs after they complete inpatient rehab. Alternatively, <a title="Intensive Outpatient Program Utah- Customized Addiction Treatment Plans Available" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/outpatient-recovery/">outpatient addiction treatment</a> is an effective option for many people, and it makes it possible for them to avoid missing time on their jobs.</p>
<h3>They Don’t Have Sufficient Childcare Resources</h3>
<p>A serious issue for many individuals coping with addiction is the absence of adequate child care options. It can be a very tough decision to entrust the care of one’s child to another person. But, the choice to recover from addiction is the most important thing a parent can do for their child and herself or himself, making it the right decision in every case of substance addiction.</p>
<p>After all, the alternative is potentially allowing alcohol or drug addiction to cause job loss and loss of child custody. Recovering from addiction is the most practical way to avoid those outcomes and do your best for your child.</p>
<h3>They’re Worried About the Stigma of Addiction and Rehab</h3>
<p>Nearly 20% of individuals who do not seek addiction treatment say their worried about their reputation. They fear what their spouse, family, neighbors, coworkers, employers, and others in their community will think of them if they go into drug or alcohol rehab. They naturally fear social judgment, because addiction is stigmatized in the U.S. However, contrary to their fears, the majority of families and friends want their loved ones to recover from addiction and not go on suffering with it.</p>
<h3>There Is No Treatment Program in Their Area</h3>
<p>A serious obstacle to treatment for substance addiction is often the lack of treatment options. The need for rehab is accelerating more rapidly than new treatment facilities are opening throughout the country. In cities, rehab facilities often have lengthy waiting lists for admission, and in <a title="Alcohol and Drug Rehab Treatment Center Service Areas" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/alcohol-and-drug-rehab-treatment-center-service-areas/">rural areas</a>, people seeking addiction treatment are sometimes forced to travel many miles for treatment.</p>
<p>There are some effective alternatives, including seeking help from a person’s family doctor. They can attend support groups, and they can start in AA or Narcotics Anonymous while waiting to begin rehab.</p>

<h2>Asking for the Help You Need Is the Smart Choice</h2>
<p>There are countless reasons for not seeking treatment for substance addiction, but you don’t need to wait until things are much worse before you reach out and ask for the help you need. Addiction treatment and relapse prevention are more likely to be easier and more effective long-term when individuals seek the help they need before their addiction grows more severe.</p>

Falling into old habits is all too easy in </span><span class="s2">Salt Lake City</span><span class="s1"> if you don&#8217;t take control of your social calendar in this way. Here is a </span><span class="s2">list of sober activities</span><span class="s1"> in </span><span class="s2">Utah</span><span class="s1"> that we hope will help you with your recovery.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4928"></span></p>
<h2 class="p2"><span class="s1">1. Host a Dinner Party</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The nice thing about hosting a dinner party is that <b><i>you</i> </b>control the menu. There&#8217;s always a risk that if you show up for someone else&#8217;s dinner party, there will end up being an open bar or an extensive wine list. If you host your own party for family or friends, you can <b><i>pick out a great selection of music, prepare some new foods and provide plenty of non-alcoholic drinks for the guests</i></b>.</span></p>
<h2 class="p2"><span class="s1">2. Exercise</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Working out helps you stay in tune with your body and realize your potential. Jogging, yoga, swimming, weight lifting, cardio and other activities will <b><i>help with goal-setting</i></b>, and the constant improvement from working out is a <b><i>big confidence booster</i></b>. If you purchase a gym membership, you&#8217;re likely to <b><i>make new sober friends and meet others who are into taking care of their bodies</i></b>. Golf is another great exercise that you can do alone or with a group.</span></p>
<h2 class="p2"><span class="s1">3. Get Outdoors</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are some amazing national parks and outdoor areas within just a few hours&#8217; drive of </span><span class="s2">SLC</span><span class="s1">. Head out of town on a Saturday morning and stay the night for a camping trip. Go for a hike! Get a fishing license and try your hand at catching and preparing your own food. <b><i>Connect with nature, get some fresh air and recharge your batteries</i></b> by getting out of the busy city for a day or two.</span></p>
<h2 class="p2"><span class="s1">4. Volunteer</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Giving back some of your time to help others is one of the most<b><i> rewarding</i></b> things you will ever do. You can volunteer at a homeless shelter, a food bank, an animal rescue shelter or any number of church ministry activities to help others in the local community. </span><span class="s2">Sober activities</span><span class="s1"> that involve giving back to the community will <b><i>help you stay centered and keep your mind on the &#8220;bigger picture&#8221; in life</i></b>.</span></p>
<h2 class="p2"><span class="s1">5. Grow a Garden</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Nothing<b><i> teaches patience</i></b> like growing your own vegetables, herbs or flowers. You don&#8217;t need to have a spare acre in your backyard to plant a garden. Even if you live in an apartment, you can still grow smaller plants in a patio garden or on your kitchen counter, as long as your plants can get some direct sunlight during the day.</span></p>
<h2 class="p4"><span class="s1">Get on the Road to Recovery at Pathways Recovery Center in SLC, Utah</span></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='The Basics of Overdose' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/the-basics-of-overdose/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p><a href="http://www.health.utah.gov/vipp/topics/prescription-drug-overdoses/">According to the 2014 statistics</a> from the Utah Department of Health, 32% of Utah adults had been on prescribed opioid pain medication. Drug poisoning deaths in Utah have<strong><em> surpassed</em></strong> deaths due to other causes such as firearms, motor vehicle accidents, and falls. Misuse of addictive prescription medications such as opioids can result in<strong><em> personal and legal consequences</em></strong>. <strong><em>It is estimated that 23 Utahns die every month from prescription drug overdoses</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Here is an overdose 101 detailed look at the basics of overdose and <strong><em>what to do if someone overdoses.</em></strong> Below are some overdose basics to aid in understanding the topic better;</p>
<h2>What is an Overdose?</h2>
<p>A drug overdose occurs when one takes a drug or a combination of different medications above and beyond the prescribed limit. Overdose signs differ with the type of drug used. As such,<strong><em> it is vital to know the right amount and time of taking your medication to avoid an overdose</em></strong>.</p>
<p><span id="more-4920"></span></p>
<h3>Types of Drugs and Signs of Overdose</h3>
<h4>Opioids and Depressants</h4>
<p><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/why-is-heroin-so-addictive/"><em>Heroin</em></a> and other pharmaceutical opioids such as <em>Endone</em>, <em>benzodiazepines</em>, and <em>barbiturates</em> produce a calming effect by slowing down the central nervous system. <strong><em>Depressants</em></strong> <strong><em>slow down the vital activities of the body such as breathing and the heart rate</em></strong>. These substances can be prescribed to a patient who has a sleeping problem and for purposes of relieving pain. However, <strong><em>when taken in large amounts or mixed they can cause permanent brain damage and overdose</em></strong>, which will lead to depressing normal body functions such as breathing and eventual slowing down of the heart rate that can result in death.</p>
<h4>Alcohol</h4>
<p>Alcohol is used recreationally to produce a calming effect by slowing down the central nervous system. Although most people don’t consider extreme consumption of alcohol as an overdose, <strong><em>alcohol is a strong depressant</em></strong> that can lead to an overdose if consumed uncontrollably. For example, <strong><em>binge drinking can lead to acute alcohol poisoning</em></strong>.</p>
<h4>Stimulants</h4>
<p>An overdose of stimulants such as <em>amphetamines</em> can increase the <strong><em>risk of stroke and seizures.</em></strong></p>
<h2>Tolerance and Half-life</h2>
<p>It is possible to develop tolerance when using a drug regularly. Although a person who has developed tolerance will need more of the drug to get the same effect, he/she can also lose the tolerance if he doesn’t use the drug for a while. Also,<strong><em> if someone takes the usual amount of prescription medication after a break from using the drug, it could also lead to an overdose.</em></strong> That is why using drugs after periods of abstinence such as release from prison or after leaving a drug rehab center can cause an overdose.</p>
<p>Half-life is the time it takes for a particular drug’s strength or effect to drop to half of its original dose. Benzodiazepines drugs are known to have a longer half-life. In other words, <strong><em>if an individual used the drug yesterday, he/she may still have enough in the system to get an overdose, if the same drug is used today</em></strong>.</p>
<h2>Drug Overdose First Aid</h2>
<p>Drug overdose symptoms depend on a range of factors, such as medical history, type of drug used and amount of drug taken. <strong><em>Don’t assume someone who has overdosed is asleep because it can take several hours for someone who has overdosed to die</em></strong>. This is a medical emergency that necessitates <strong><em><u>immediate medical attention</u></em></strong>. Call an ambulance, if you suspect that someone has a drug overdose.</p>

It did not take long for Robert Downey Jr. to become addicted.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Downey_Jr." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Downey Jr</a>. was born in April of 1965. His father, Robert Downey Sr., was an avant-garde film director with a passion for social issues. Downey Senior was also enthusiastic about drugs. In the 1988 book The New Breed, Downey said he grew up in a house where there were a lot of drugs just lying around. Unlike most households of the time where fathers and sons bonded over baseball or cars, the Downey family shared a love of acting and a passion for drugs.</p>
<p><span id="more-3599"></span></p>
<p>Junior made his film debut at the age of five, in his father’s 1970s film <em>Pound</em>. Robert Downey Jr. worked at a frantic pace during the 1980s and 1990s, appearing in a dizzying number of comedies, crime thrillers and dramas. Robert Downey Jr. quickly became one of the most sought-after young actors of his time.</p>
<p>Father and son shared their drug abuse for several years, even as both acting professionals were soaring to new career heights.  “When my dad and I would do drugs together,” Robert Downey Jr. said, “it was like him trying to express his love for me in the only way he knew how.”</p>
<h2>The Dark Years</h2>
<p>Despite his phenomenal success as an actor, Downey was struggling with drug addiction. As his career advanced, so did his drug addiction and the bizarre and antisocial behavior that often accompanies substance abuse. Neighbors once even found Downey passed out in their 11-year-old son’s bed, and called the police before realizing it was RDJ.</p>
<p>In June of 1996, police pulled Downey over for speeding and found three different types of drugs and an unloaded .357 Magnum under the passenger seat of his car. The judge sentenced him to a rehabilitation facility, where he broke out wearing a Hawaiian shirt and hospital pants. The next judge sentenced him to a more secure rehab facility, where he promptly busted out.</p>
<p>The actor found himself in front of a judge in 1999, begging against a prison sentence. Downey told the judge, &#8220;It’s like I have a shotgun in my mouth and I’ve got my finger on the trigger, and <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/09/robert-downey-jr-addiction-children" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I like the taste of the gunmetal</a>.”</p>
<p>The judge sentenced Robert Downey Jr. to 36 months at the high minimum-security facility California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison on drug charges but served less than a year. After his release in 2000, he joined the cast of the hit televisions series Ally McBeal where he played the love interest of the lead actress Calista Flockhart. Critics raved about his performance and even handed Downey a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film.</p>
<p>Police arrested Downey twice more before the talented actor got clean. Late in 2000, police responded to an anonymous call to Downey’s Palm Springs hotel room, where they found drugs. In the spring of 2001 police found Downey wandering barefoot through the streets of Culver City in Los Angeles. After his arrest, the actor checked himself into rehab.</p>
<p>By then, producers had written Robert Downey Jr. out of Ally McBeal. Downey became box office poison. George Clooney and Mel Gibson, among others, tossed work his way but most critics considered Robert Downey Jr. washed up. Gibson said of Downey, “What’s happening there? And you know he’s his own worst enemy. He’s flawed. We’re all flawed. My God, I’m more flawed than he is! It’s something you recognize and have empathy with, but the guy made this amazing bid for life that’s nothing short of astounding. I admire him. He’s done it himself. Nobody else can do it for you.”</p>
<h2>The Rise of Iron Man</h2>
<p>It was then that Robert Downey Jr. transformed himself into an ironclad superhero of epic proportions – literally. He got the treatment he needed from qualified rehabilitation professionals.</p>
<p>Robert Downey Jr. crashed back onto the Hollywood scene in the 2008 smash live action film hit Iron Man. Like the fictional hero, Downey was a wealthy, glamorous ladies’ man who hid a dark secret.</p>
<p>In much the same way as the hero he plays in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_(2008_film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iron Man</a>, Tony Stark, Downey created a powered suit of armor to escape the captivity of addiction and save his life. Instead of creating a suit of strength from iron, however, Downey utilized the tremendous power of professional treatment for his drug problem. Later in the movie, Tony Stark augments his iron suit with weapons created by his company. Downey followed suit by optimizing the protective shell of sobriety with tools created by his craft – acting.</p>
<p>That stay in a court-ordered drug treatment program helped Robert Downey Jr. finally achieve the sobriety he enjoys today. In 2013, Downey topped <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/2013/07/16/robert-downey-jr-tops-forbes-list-of-hollywoods-highest-paid-actors/?utm_campaign=forbestwittersf&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a> list of Hollywood’s Highest-Paid Actors, nabbing $75 million in earnings just between June 2012 and June 2013. Robert Downey Jr. became the world’s highest paid star in 2014.</p>
<p>Robert Downey Jr. not only played a superhero in the movies, he became one in real life. People with addictions of all sorts, especially those with drug addictions, can learn from the actor’s quest to break free from the captivity of addiction and achieve true success in life. Robert Downey Jr. fulfilled his own destiny to become a human being no longer hiding under a film of addiction, and projected this fulfillment on the international stage.</p>
<p>Today, Robert Downey, Jr. is content with being Robert Downey, Jr., and that has fueled the transformation from addiction to ironclad superhero.</p>
<p>“Job one is get out of that cave,” Downey said in an October 2014 interview with Vanity Fair. “A lot of people do get out but don’t change. So the thing is to get out and recognize the significance of that aggressive denial of your fate, come through the crucible forged into a stronger metal.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='3 Things Successful Drug &amp; Alcohol Treatment Centers Must Do' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/3-successful-drug-alcohol-treatment-centers/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p>Addictions are tough to treat. Each is different and shaped by factors including the person&#8217;s medical history, financial situation and childhood trauma. If you know a friend or family member dealing with drug or alcohol addiction, don&#8217;t just point them to the nearest treatment center. Find a caring clinic that will strive to understand your loved one as a person and not just a case. Here are 3 actions that successful drug &amp; alcohol treatment centers might take:</p>
<p><span id="more-3177"></span></p>
<h2><b>Successful Drug &amp; Alcohol Treatment Facilities Match Patients with the Most Compatible Medications at the Correct Dosage</b></h2>
<p>Every person is unique. The best medication for one person may do more harm than good for another. Reliable treatment centers provide individual genetic testing to optimize treatment. Once a patient&#8217;s DNA is sampled and analyzed, clinics can identify the most effective prescription, including dosage and frequency. The treatment center will then monitor the effects of the prescription and modify it as the patient improves. While DNA-prescription matching isn&#8217;t foolproof, it offers a much higher standard of care than generic prescriptions. Treatment centers that offer this service likely also practice other forms of individualized care</p>
<h2><b>Successful Drug &amp; Alcohol Treatment Facilities Examine All Underlying Triggers</b></h2>
<p>According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, &#8220;To be effective, treatment must address the individual&#8217;s drug abuse and any associated medical, psychological, social, vocational, and legal problems.&#8221; Co-occurring disorders such as depression, stress, mental disorders, etc. may trigger or compound addiction in many patients. It&#8217;s paramount for treatment centers to understand these hardships on a personal level. A recent study revealed that nearly 60 percent of unemployed men consumed more than eight drinks per day over the course of one week compared to 34 percent of employed men. Stress and uncertainty likely contributed to the unemployed men&#8217;s behavior. Successful treatment centers know to look for triggers such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social anxiety</li>
<li>Financial issues</li>
<li>Eating disorders</li>
<li>Witnessing or having suffered from abuse or violence</li>
</ul>
<p>Because addictions may persist or recur if the underlying triggers aren&#8217;t managed, knowledgeable treatment centers offer specialized training or community outreach programs to help patients heal as a whole, not just as an addict. Behavioral therapy such as family or group counseling may also be effective.</p>
<h2><b>Successful Drug &amp; Alcohol Treatment Facilities Treat Enduring Trauma</b></h2>
<p>Because most addiction treatment programs only last a few months, it&#8217;s essential that they provide people with the necessary tools to counter cravings on their own. Trauma from post-traumatic stress disorder, domestic abuse, or other forms of enduring shock can sway a recovering addict toward substances that may numb their fear or pain.</p>
<p>Therapy sessions can greatly benefit trauma victims, allowing them to speak openly about the triggering event(s). The therapist may assign reading or journal writing to be completed after each meeting, and encourage the person to practice light stretching or breathing exercises. The success of a therapy program depends on the commitment of the person and the people around him. As such, the person&#8217;s family members and living partners should learn as much as possible about the addiction. Group healing can help a family come together and create an environment free of temptation. Successful treatment centers may also provide a network of current or former addicts from whom the person can relate to and seek advice.</p>
<p>If you or someone you love is ready to stop hurting and start healing, give <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/">Salt Lake City&#8217;s premier addiction recovery facility, Pathways Real Life Recovery a call today</a>.</p>

At Pathways, we want to make sure you have the best tools at your disposal to achieve your goals. We will show you how transitioning from negativity to a more positive outlook can improve every aspect of your life.</p>
<h2>What is Self-Talk?</h2>
<p><span id="more-3134"></span></p>
<p>Self-talk isn&#8217;t limited to just your thoughts – it also includes your beliefs and feelings about yourself and the world around you. Self-talk can be either conscious or subconscious, and it affects everything that you do. Negative self-talk leads to a negative attitude that causes you to sabotage yourself. Positive self-talk, on the other hand, helps you to feel better about yourself and puts you in the right frame of mind to achieve success. Learning to correct negative thinking patterns is all about seizing control of your inner dialogue and breaking thought patterns that you have been building and developing your entire life.</p>
<h2>How Does Negative Thinking Affect You?</h2>
<p>According to an <strong>article in Psychology Today</strong>, negative thoughts have a big impact on brain function. Not only does negative thinking make it harder for you to think logically, but the fear of failure that is often associated with negativity slows down activity in the cerebellum. This results in a reduced ability to come up with creative solutions to the problems you face.</p>
<p>That fear of failure that negative thinkers often have also affects the left temporal lobe of the brain. Not only do your fears drag your mood down, but you may suffer from a bad memory or poor impulse control.</p>
<p>When you make a habit of negative thinking, you are essentially re-wiring your brain. As you focus on all those fears and worries, the brain actually begins to change, strengthening the synapses and neurons that are most closely associated with negative thought.</p>
<p>The changes in your brain are what makes it so difficult to overcome a negative attitude. You aren&#8217;t simply working to correct negative thoughts – you are working against thoughts and beliefs that have become so deeply ingrained that they are a part of the structure of your brain.</p>
<h2>Re-Training Your Brain with Positive Thoughts</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the changes made to your brain by negative thought processes are reversible – you can use the power of optimism to undo the damage caused by years of fear, worry and anxiety. Scientists have found that positive people have much more activity in the pre-frontal cortex of the brain.</p>
<p>When you think of positive thought like a workout for your brain, it&#8217;s easy to see how simply thinking good things and striving to have a positive attitude can reshape your outlook on life. As you begin to use optimism and positive affirmations, you will be firing up neurons and synapses that haven&#8217;t seen a lot of use. Just like physical exercise, as you strengthen your neural pathways, it will become easier and easier to have a positive attitude.</p>
<h2>Using Positive Affirmations to Improve the Quality of Your Life</h2>
<p>Positive affirmations are the tool you will use to improve your negative thinking patterns. These affirmations come in the form of short, optimistic statements. A good positive affirmation will target the particular beliefs that are the foundation of your negative thought processes. As you repeat your positive affirmations, your subconscious mind will take hold of these new positive thoughts and your negative thoughts will begin to disappear.</p>
<p>Affirmations are widely used by counselors because they have an incredibly powerful effect on your entire life. As you work on correcting your negative self-talk, you will gain self-confidence and you&#8217;ll be better equipped to handle the stress in your life. With less negativity, you will find that your relationships with family, friends or your spouse will become less strained, and you may find that you have a greater interest in social activities.</p>
<p>Instead of telling yourself that good events happen because of chance, you will start to believe that good events happened because you worked to make them happen. Since you worked hard to make great things happen, you&#8217;ll be more willing to keep working towards positive goals. People who change their thought processes from negative to positive often find new doors opening in their lives. Before, a career change or a great new relationship may have seemed impossible, but with a positive outlook, you will have the tools to make those things happen.</p>
<p>The best part about positive affirmations is that you should start to see the benefits immediately. Some people have to work harder than others to completely eliminate negative thought patterns. However, even on the first day, you should see some improvements to your confidence while the fears and worries that you&#8217;ve held for so long will start to fade.</p>
<h2>Your New Optimistic Outlook Brings Health Benefits Too</h2>
<p>Positive self-talk isn&#8217;t just about improving how you feel about yourself. As you use positive affirmations to improve your thinking patterns, you&#8217;ll also find that it comes with several health benefits. Happy, positive people make healthy lifestyle choices. You&#8217;ll be more likely to exercise and eat right. Studies have also shown that optimists have better immune systems.</p>
<p>According to <strong>research from the University of Pittsburgh</strong>, positive people live longer too. Over eight years, the study found that women over the age of 50 who were optimists were 14-percent less likely to die than pessimistic women. When the researchers looked at women who died from heart disease, the positive thinkers were 30-percent less likely to die.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='display:none;' class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-title='How to Approach the Subject of Substance Abuse with Your Teen' data-link='https://pathwaysreallife.com/approach-subject-substance-abuse-teen/' data-app-id-name='category_above_content'></div><p>By the time they reach the age of 18, about half of all teenagers in the United States have abused a drug at some point in their lives. This is why it&#8217;s so important for parents to talk candidly with their children about the realities and dangers of drug use at a young age. In fact, studies have shown that parents can reduce the risk of their teenagers using drugs up to 42% by simply talking with them about drug use regularly. However, what&#8217;s a parent to do if he or she suspects a teen already has a drug problem? This can be a tricky situation, but by handling it appropriately, parents can ensure the best possible outcome.<br />
<span id="more-3126"></span></p>
<h2>Make Note of Warning Signs</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re a parent or guardian who suspects that your child has a drug problem, it&#8217;s important that you gather &#8220;evidence&#8221; before confronting your teen. After all, the last thing you want is to accuse your child of something he or she isn&#8217;t guilty of. Therefore, before speaking with your child, be on the lookout for these common warning signs of a drug abuse problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hanging out with the &#8220;wrong&#8221; crowd</li>
<li>Sudden weight loss</li>
<li>Bloodshot eyes</li>
<li>Lack of energy and change of sleep habits</li>
<li>Unexplained drop in grades at school</li>
</ul>
<p>Make note of these warning signs by writing them down so that you can bring them up in the conversation you have with your child.</p>
<h2>Being Calm and Assertive</h2>
<p>When it comes time to actually have the conversation with your child, be sure to pick a good time for it, such as over a weekend and not before a big test or game. If you suspect that your child is under the influence, put off the conversation until you&#8217;re sure he or she is sober.</p>
<p>Upon confronting a teen about drug use, don&#8217;t <em>ask</em> your child if he or she has been using. Instead, tell your child that you have a strong feeling or that you <em>know </em>it&#8217;s happening. This will make it clear up front that you won&#8217;t tolerate being lied to and that you already know what&#8217;s going on. During the initial part of the conversation, it&#8217;s important to be both calm and assertive. Let your child know that you love him or her and that you only want what&#8217;s best for his or her future. Tell your child that you also want to help him or her overcome the drug abuse problem in any way you can.</p>
<p>At the same time, make it clear that you will <em>not </em>tolerate drug use from your child. At this point, he or she may shut down on you and not want to talk about the subject any further. As a parent, however, you need to be persistent. Try to sympathize with your child and offer to seek professional help; if your child is under the age of 18, he or she may not have a choice, though you&#8217;ll be off to a better start if you can get your child to admit to the problem and actually <em>want</em> to seek help.</p>
<p>It may take awhile for your teen to come around, but once he or she does, be sure to follow through on your promise by finding the outpatient treatment program that&#8217;s best for your child and that will allow him or her to get the help needed without having to miss school.</p>

I, better than anyone, have learned that the same people who would not hesitate to seek professional help for a physical illness will hesitate before seeking treatment for substance abuse because the first step always means admitting the problem.</p>
<p><span id="more-3119"></span></p>
<p>Often, close friends and family members would also eagerly urge treatment for physical or even mental illness, but with substance abuse, they ask, &#8220;Why can&#8217;t you just stop?&#8221; The right question to ask should be, &#8220;Where can you get help?&#8221;</p>
<p>I am proud to be able to provide that help, and my first task is usually to help patients understand how proud they should be for taking the first step towards <a href="/our-services/">recovery</a>. Knowing that you try to hide substance abuse might be a source of shame, but working towards recovery should be a source of pride.</p>
<h2>What Keeps People Away from Treatment?</h2>
<p>A few people may have difficulty admitting they have a problem to themselves. However, I have seen plenty of patients who have no trouble recognizing their own destructive behavior. These individuals waited before seeking treatment because of very valid concerns over losing their jobs, losing the right to care for their children, and losing the respect of the people around them. In other words, they worried about the stigma attached to their previous behavior and how admitting it might impact their future.</p>
<h2>Know Your Rights</h2>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits job discrimination against people with disabilities. These include mental and physical disabilities, and the law specifically includes recovering addicts and alcoholics. Employees who are currently enrolled in treatment or have successfully completed treatment can&#8217;t get fired because of behavior before the treatment started.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Family and Medical Leave Act requires employers to grant time off for legitimate health-related reasons. Rather than indulge in concerns that seeking help will jeopardize employment, most addicts and alcoholics should probably be more concerned that a lack of treatment could ruin current and future employment prospects.</p>
<h3>What if Children are Involved?</h3>
<p>Most substance abusers are not violent or actively abusive, but it is not hard to argue that substance abuse often leads to the type of neglect that gets authorities involved. The solution for parents with concerns over their families is to seek treatment rather than avoid it.</p>
<p>One thing that caseworkers do when they assess cases is identify strengths that can help make a situation better, and a parent actively seeking treatment and working towards recovery is a strength. Untreated substance abuse is not.</p>
<h3>How Does Treatment Help Overcome the Stigma of Substance Abuse?</h3>
<p>If you struggle with substance abuse, you already confront fear of the future, guilt over past behavior, and shame because of what other people might think or do. You probably expend a lot of energy dealing with these negative and painful emotions too. The first step to take in order to put all of that behind you is to seek treatment from professional counselors.</p>
<p>I want to help my recovering patients feel pride because of their behavior, optimistic about the future, and joyful over relationships that may recover as an addict recovers. Recovery can be the beginning of a new stage or your life, better family relationships, more job prospects, and a life you can be proud of.</p>

People <a href="/recovery-program/">struggling with addiction, looking for help</a>, have also been curious as to what this new program may offer them in the way of help kicking their drug and alcohol habit. Now that open enrollment in the government ACA website has ended, let us discuss what addicts and family members need to know, so they can take advantage of the next round of enrollment at an exchange or when purchasing private insurance outside one of the government sanctioned health exchanges.</p>
<p><span id="more-3105"></span></p>
<h2>Extended Recovery Assistance</h2>
<p>When it comes to persons struggling with addiction, the ACA extends recovery assistance in four ways. First the ACA makes mental health coverage a mandatory component for new individual health insurance plans and small business plans. While the ACA mandate does not extend to the large corporate plans, it does provide a helping hand to single-person plans and people suffering with addiction who work for a small company.</p>
<h2>Parity Between Types of Treatment</h2>
<p>Additionally, the ACA law also demands parity between addiction and mental health coverage and traditional medical treatments. What does &#8220;parity&#8221; mean in the context of our discussion? Simply put, it means that insurance companies cannot charge you more for mental health or addiction coverage than they do for things like emergency room visits and doctors appointments, just because one is psychological and the other is physical. This may sound familiar to readers who recall the 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (<em>MHPAEA</em>) which sought to achieve the same goal, but left loopholes in which companies could simply drop all mental health coverage and avoid the additional expense of offering insurance to their employees.</p>
<h2>Insurance Company Changes</h2>
<p>The ACA also demands that insurance companies provide coverage for preexisting conditions. As the struggle with addiction begins early in life, often during the formative teenage years, this is good news for people who are struggling with addiction. Now a history of drug and alcohol abuse or psychological disorders like bipolar disorder, cannot be used as factors in denying coverage. Some may voice concern that premiums may rise, or have indeed risen, to compensate for this additional coverage. Others in our nation&#8217;s capital remind us that access and parity for co-pays and charges should make-up for any other change in expense.</p>
<h2>Psychological Help Included</h2>
<p>The new offer of psychological help for persons from all walks of life is also a well intentioned change to current rules and regulations. Mental health is not just for persons suffering from bipolar disorder or the more extreme cases of schizophrenia. Mental health treatment under the ACA applies to people who are just going through a tough emotional time and are in need of help. Every day people face the crisis of losing their jobs, going through divorces, custody battles and other life events that can plunge them into depression or a destructive spiral of self medicating, overusing alcohol and tobacco. The ACA seeks to help everyone from all walks of life, before they even know they need help.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>As part of the implementation of this landmark process to show greater compassion for those suffering from addiction, the ACA has also made putting a stop to smoking tobacco a requirement for insurance providers. Those needing to kick the habit will be able to get the assistance they need, without need of a co-pay, via the government approved plans made available in the healthcare exchanges. Not all medications designed for use kicking the smoking habit will be covered by the program, but it is once again a great step in the right direction. It should, however, be noted that Medicaid will not offer treatments to help people stop smoking.</p>
<h2>Young People<img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-3107" alt="Substance Abuse" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Substance-Abuse.png" width="341" height="1024" srcset="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Substance-Abuse.png 341w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Substance-Abuse-100x300.png 100w, https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Substance-Abuse-300x901.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" /></h2>
<p>Young people also have the advantage of knowing they can remain on their parent&#8217;s insurance up until the age of 26. For the purpose of our discussion today, this goes hand-in-hand with new regulations regarding preexisting conditions. Now that young people can retain the health benefits they had as a child and teenager, it will be easier for them to seek help with their substance abuse problems and find treatment. This also could give parents a greater hand in the recovery process as the primary insurance holders.</p>
<h2>What Else Does it Provide?</h2>
<p>Finally, the ACA has measures designed to provide &#8220;Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment&#8221;, also known as SBIRT. This program run by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (<em>SAMHSA</em>) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (<em>HRSA</em>), has been structured to allow professionals to make early determinations of addiction regardless of an identified disorder, then compel treatment for people at risk of addiction before it becomes a diagnosable problem.</p>
<h2>Addiciton Prevention</h2>
<p>In an ongoing government effort to curtail drug and alcohol abuse, medical professionals who work in the employee of hospitals, clinics, primary care physicians and even employee assistance programs at a person&#8217;s work can now compel people to answer a three-question survey that indicates whether a person may already have or be developing an issue with addiction. If this first survey suggests there could be a problem, they can next compel someone to take a more detailed assessment, usually the <a title="AUDIT" href="http://www.agencymeddirectors.wa.gov/Files/aas.pdf">AUDIT</a> questioner or the <a title="ASSIST" href="http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/activities/assist_v3_english.pdf" target="_blank">ASSIST</a> exam.</p>
<h2>What If I Fail the Test?</h2>
<p>Responses to either of these communications can lead to a &#8220;brief intervention&#8221;, usually consisting of a 30 minute discussion about addiction and the importance of personal responsibility. In some cases, these brief interventions can lead to an order for brief treatment that can last up to 12 one-hour sessions, or a referral to treatment. Local laws and agencies can become involved at this point and thus the degree of which someone may be compelled into treatment varies depending upon the state you live in. As an example, Florida&#8217;s <a title="Marchman Act" href="http://www.dcf.state.fl.us/programs/samh/SubstanceAbuse/marchman/marchmanacthand03p.pdf" target="_blank">Marchman Act</a> provides the legal standing to involuntary commit someone to a treatment program.</p>
<h2>Preemptive Tools</h2>
<p>In the end, all of these legal and financial measures are designed to provide preemptive tools meant to foster preventive care and save the taxpayers money. It lays down the policies that can compel needed screenings for possible addiction and mental health problems, and give care providers and employers the tools they need to initiate interventions into the lives of insurance policy holders. The program has only the best of intentions and it is just one more way the Affordable Care Act works to make people healthy and well.</p>
<h2>How to Enroll</h2>
<p>Enrollment into insurance can be complicated by the Affordable Care Act. Insurance companies and members of the government implementing the law expressed worry over persons waiting to sign-up for health insurance after an accident. Persons in the government also worried that insurance companies may harass people recently injured or in need of medical attention, pestering them to sign-up for coverage. To prevent this, personal and family insurance are no longer available all-year-round. While corporate and business plans can still be entered into when offered, plans an individual person may get for themselves or their family will only be available during designated &#8220;open enrollment&#8221; times throughout the year.</p>
<h2>Exceptions to Open Enrollment Policy</h2>
<p>As the government does understand that some people may have a life event that necessitates a change in insurance, there are some specific circumstances in which a person may still apply for coverage outside the approved open enrollment periods. Some qualifying life events include marriage, divorce, the birth of a child, termination from employment and a qualifying change in income, or the death of a spouse.</p>
<h2>Why Should I Sign Up?</h2>
<p>Signing up for insurance coverage during these time periods, particularly for those persons who currently do not have the protections offered by these services, is encouraged. Treatment centers, intensive outpatient programs and aftercare services are all supposed to be covered by insurance, no questions asked. Some delays in the implementation of specific ACA mandates made by President Obama to give states and corporations time to implement all the changes legally required by the ACA could limit or stall some services, so be sure to speak with your provider and primary care physician to make sure all your treatments are fully covered.</p>
<h2>Growing Pains</h2>
<p>As with all new programs, there is going to be a period of growing pains. It is estimated that some 40 million people who have had no previous access to mental health or substance abuse treatment, may enter into assistance programs all over the country. With limited beds and space at existing rehabilitation clinics, this could have the effect of restricting some access to treatment. It is hoped that this will only be a temporary circumstance as more health providers become available to offer treatment. Please do not let these growing pains discourage you from seeking help for yourself, friends, or family.</p>
<h2>A Brand New Approach</h2>
<p>Remember, the Affordable Care Act is a whole new way of addressing insurance and patient care. It is the first step in tearing down an old system, and replacing it with something the government assures us will be better. Some of these changes may not translate into immediate results for everyone, but many in Washington D.C. believe that this is a good first step to providing greater access and more compassionate care for those suffering with addiction. It is something that could possible save everyone money, by finding people who do not currently addicts or suffering mental health issues, but may be susceptible to these ailment. We have a chance to find these people and help them before they plunge down the slippery slope of addiction.</p>
<h2>Please Get Help!</h2>
<p>If you are suffering form mental illness or addiction, remember that you are not alone. Your friends, your family, your loved ones and the Federal Government are all here to help you. <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/">Take the first step in getting well</a>. We live in interesting times. Don&#8217;t miss your chance to be part of the revolution.</p>
