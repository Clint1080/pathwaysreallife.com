There are typical obstacles that dishearten many people suffering from alcohol or drug addiction, causing them to <a title="Steps to Take if Your Loved One Is Unwilling to Seek Help" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/what-to-do-if-an-addict-is-unwilling-to-seek-help/">avoid seeking treatment</a> or doubt their likelihood of lasting success after rehab. In some cases, individuals face a combination of these barriers to entering a substance abuse program. But, every individual who needs alcohol or drug addiction treatment should be able and willing to receive it.</p>
<p>Although some people succeed in turning away from abusing drugs or alcohol with just support from friends or family, there are over 20 million individuals struggling with addiction in the United States who need treatment in a substance abuse center in order to overcome their dependency. In those cases, their addiction may be too extreme, or they may have a strong genetic predisposition, or there may be mental health factors or other issues which require help from rehab professionals.<br />
<span id="more-5909"></span></p>
<h2>Why Don’t People Who Need Rehab Seek Treatment?</h2>
<p>It can be extremely difficult for some people to face the prospect of starting drug or <a title="Why Choose Pathways?- Best Substance Abuse Treatment Program in Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/why-pathways/">alcohol rehabilitation treatments</a>. Some have severe cravings or even withdrawal symptoms that can intimidate them from facing the process of overcoming their addiction. Others may try to hide their addiction, because of the stigma it bears in their community around them. These are just a few of the many reasons why people avoid starting treatment.</p>
<p>The voluminous report of the <em><a title="National Survey on Drug Use and Health- SAMHSA, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality" href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/NSDUH-DetTabs2014/NSDUH-DetTabs2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health</a></em>, from DHHS’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), offers data on reasons why people do not seek treatment for substance addiction (2011-2014). The research found that among the most frequent reasons people in need of rehab treatment did not seek help included:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>8% said they believe they can quit using on their own.</em></li>
<li><em>39% did not think they could afford to go to rehab.</em></li>
<li><em>17% feared being in rehab would impact their jobs.</em></li>
<li><em>18% wanted to avoid the stigma of admitting addiction.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Overcoming Barriers To Addiction Treatment</h2>
<p>In some cases, people don’t seek addiction treatment for a combination of reasons. They may believe they can’t afford treatment. Or, they might be too fearful of telling their employer they need to go into rehab. Maybe they’re worried about being absent from work, or a lack of childcare or they may feel unable to get help due to any one of many other concerns. Here are just a few of the most common examples of concerns people have about seeking treatment for substance abuse:</p>
<h3>They Don’t Believe They Have a Serious Problem</h3>
<p>Over a third of people with substance addiction believe they’re not addicted or that they can stop using drugs or alcohol whenever they want to, without help. They often don’t see the harm their behavior is causing to their important relationships, their employment, and other areas of their lives.</p>
<p>Recognizing their need for substance abuse treatment is the necessary awakening that enables them to turn toward a new life beyond addiction, starting with getting the help they need to free themselves from substance abuse and move on to a more fulfilling life.</p>
<h3>They Believe Rehab Costs Too Much</h3>
<p>Many people struggling with addiction don’t think they can afford rehab. Generally, drug addiction rehabilitation experts recommend a minimum of 90 days<a title="Pathways Residential Inpatient Rehab Center for Drug &#038; Alcohol Addiction" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/inpatient-drug-and-alcohol-rehab/"> inpatient treatment</a> in cases of severe substance addiction.</p>
<p>The good news is that these days many drug treatment centers base the cost of rehab on a person’s income. Some drug and alcohol rehab facilities also receive government funding, enabling them to reduce the cost of treatment for people seeking rehab.</p>
<h3>They Can’t Leave Their Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Over 75% of people with drug or alcohol addiction in the United States are afraid they will lose their jobs while they’re away in rehab. Sufficient time in rehab means a greater likelihood of <a title="General Outpatient Program Utah- We Accept Most Insurance Plans and Offer Financing Options" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/general-outpatient-program/">long-term recovery success</a> and less risk of relapse.</p>
<p>Fortunately, many employers today are supportive of their employees’ decision to obtain treatment for addiction and welcome them back to their jobs after they complete inpatient rehab. Alternatively, <a title="Intensive Outpatient Program Utah- Customized Addiction Treatment Plans Available" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/outpatient-recovery/">outpatient addiction treatment</a> is an effective option for many people, and it makes it possible for them to avoid missing time on their jobs.</p>
<h3>They Don’t Have Sufficient Childcare Resources</h3>
<p>A serious issue for many individuals coping with addiction is the absence of adequate child care options. It can be a very tough decision to entrust the care of one’s child to another person. But, the choice to recover from addiction is the most important thing a parent can do for their child and herself or himself, making it the right decision in every case of substance addiction.</p>
<p>After all, the alternative is potentially allowing alcohol or drug addiction to cause job loss and loss of child custody. Recovering from addiction is the most practical way to avoid those outcomes and do your best for your child.</p>
<h3>They’re Worried About the Stigma of Addiction and Rehab</h3>
<p>Nearly 20% of individuals who do not seek addiction treatment say their worried about their reputation. They fear what their spouse, family, neighbors, coworkers, employers, and others in their community will think of them if they go into drug or alcohol rehab. They naturally fear social judgment, because addiction is stigmatized in the U.S. However, contrary to their fears, the majority of families and friends want their loved ones to recover from addiction and not go on suffering with it.</p>
<h3>There Is No Treatment Program in Their Area</h3>
<p>A serious obstacle to treatment for substance addiction is often the lack of treatment options. The need for rehab is accelerating more rapidly than new treatment facilities are opening throughout the country. In cities, rehab facilities often have lengthy waiting lists for admission, and in <a title="Alcohol and Drug Rehab Treatment Center Service Areas" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/alcohol-and-drug-rehab-treatment-center-service-areas/">rural areas</a>, people seeking addiction treatment are sometimes forced to travel many miles for treatment.</p>
<p>There are some effective alternatives, including seeking help from a person’s family doctor. They can attend support groups, and they can start in AA or Narcotics Anonymous while waiting to begin rehab.</p>

<h2>Asking for the Help You Need Is the Smart Choice</h2>
<p>There are countless reasons for not seeking treatment for substance addiction, but you don’t need to wait until things are much worse before you reach out and ask for the help you need. Addiction treatment and relapse prevention are more likely to be easier and more effective long-term when individuals seek the help they need before their addiction grows more severe.</p>

<p>Given that each person is unique, there are a multitude of treatment approaches and solutions offered to accommodate a person&#8217;s beliefs, their particular dependence and other possible concerns that may be necessary to resolve. For example, if you were agnostic, you would probably feel miserable in a recovery program that puts heavy emphasis on Christian values. The same idea pertains to those with a holistic lifestyle, they might feel uneasy with a substance replacement program because they wish to rehabilitate themselves in a natural way. At Pathways Real Life Recovery, we cater each treatment program to suit your unique wants and needs.</p>

<h2>Principles of Successful Treatment</h2>
<p>30 years of research has proven that to defeat addiction, avoid relapse, and make life long recovery a reality, there are a number of important factors. The following key principles are the basis of any successful treatment program:</p>
<ul>
<li>No one treatment will work for everyone.</li>
<li>Access to treatment should be readily available.</li>
<li>Addiction is a complex but treatable condition that has the ability to affect behaviors and healthy brain function.</li>
<li>Effective treatment addresses the root cause of addiction, as well as other possible mental disorders, and not just the symptom of</li>
<li>drug use. Treatment should help a person be healthy in mind and body.</li>
<li>Staying in treatment long enough is critical to success.</li>
<li>Counseling and other behavioral therapies are the most commonly used forms of treatment.</li>
<li>Medications are often an important part of treatment, especially when combined with behavioral therapies.</li>
<li>Treatment plans should be regularly reviewed and modified to fit a person&rsquo;s changing needs.</li>
<li>Medically assisted detoxification is only the first stage of treatment.</li>
<li>Treatment doesn&#8217;t need to be voluntary to be effective.</li>
<li>Drug use during treatment must be monitored continuously.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<h3>What is Health Information?</h3>
<p>Health Information is a part of the Personal Information that we collect about Patients and falls into two categories:</p>
<p>&#8220;Protected Health Information&#8221; is individually identifiable health information which is created or received by or on behalf of a covered entity (for example, a health careprovider or health plan) and which relates to the past, present or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual, the provision of health care to an individual, or the past, present or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual. Protected Health Information is further defined by the federal Health<br />
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and is subject to the protections of HIPAA.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<p>&#8220;Additional Health Information&#8221; is a subset of Health Information that does not fall within the category of Protected Health Information above. For example, this would encompass information related to past, present or future physical or mental health or conditions, the provision of health care to an individual, or the past, present or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual but with the difference that such information was not created or received by us from or on behalf of a covered entity. We may collect Additional Health Information in connection with the Site or Applications.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<h3>How We Use and/or Share Protected Health Information and Additional Health<br />
Information</h3>
<p>We may use and/or disclose Protected Health Information and Additional Health Information to provide the Services as described in this policy, except our use and disclosure of Protected Health Information is further limited by the main federal health privacy law known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and the Notice of Privacy Practices available from your Provider. We will use and disclose Protected Health Information only to provide Services to the Patient or the Provider, for those uses and disclosures permitted by HIPAA, and the agreement that we have with your Provider. In the event that there is a conflict or inconsistency about the handling of Protected Health Information between (i) this Privacy Policy and (ii) our compliance obligations with HIPAA and contractual commitments with Providers, then the latter will govern.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<h3>Non-Personal Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
<p>We may automatically collect the following information about your use of our Site or Services through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies: your domain name; your browser type and operating system; web pages you view; links you click; your IP<br />
address; the length of time you visit our Site or use our Services; and the referring URL, or the webpage that led you to our Site, and the following: access time, browser type, device ID, domain name, IP address, page views and referring URL. We also<br />
may collect the following information about your use of the Application: mobile device ID; location and language information; device name and model; operating system type, name, and version; your activities within the Application; and the length<br />
of time that you are logged into our Application. We may combine this information with other information that we have collected about you, including, where applicable, your user name, name, and other personal information. Please see the section “Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms” below for more information.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<h3>Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms</h3>
<p>We and our third-party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Site or Services. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third-party service providers may do so on our behalf).<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<p>Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions in the Third Party Ad Network section.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<p>Cookies: Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Service. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<p>Session Cookies: Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<p>Persistent Cookies: Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We do not currently use persistent cookies on the Site.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<p>Disabling Cookies: Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<p>Local Storage Objects: We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) to store your Site preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose “Website Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.<br />&nbsp;</br> </p>
<p>Third-Party Analytics: We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site and, to the extent permitted, our Applications. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services. We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. We do not share your personal information with these third parties.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<p>With respect to Google Analytics specifically, we may collect the some or all of the following information about your use of our Site and Applications, and we may be able to connect this information to other information we have about you:</p>
<ul>
<li> Pages visited, time of visit, and time spent on each page of the webpages
<li> Type of web browser
<li> Type of operating system (OS)
<li> Screen resolution
<li> IP address
<li> Third-Party Links
</ul>
<p>Our Site and Services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<h3>Security of Personal Information</h3>
<p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect Personal Information under our control, and Protected Health Information  specifically, per the HIPAA rules. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@pathwaysreallife.com">info@pathwaysreallife.com</a> .You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<h3>Access to My Personal Information</h3>
<p>You may modify Personal Information that you have submitted by logging into your account and updating your profile information. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified or deleted may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Site or Application for a period of time.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<p>You may also contact us directly if you would like to review, correct, update, delete or otherwise limit our use of your Personal Information that has been previously provided to us by sending us a message through <a href="mailto:info@pathwaysreallife.com">info@pathwaysreallife.com</a> . In your request, please make clear what information you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your Personal Information deleted from our database or otherwise let us know what limitations you would like to put on our use of your Personal Information. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that in order to comply with certain requests to limit use of your Personal Information we may need to terminate your account with us and your ability to access and use the Services, and you agree that we will not be liable to you for such termination. Although we will use reasonable efforts to do so, you understand that it may not be technologically possible to remove from our systems every record of your Personal Information. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means a copy of your Personal Information may exist in a non- erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate or remove. We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<h3>What Choices Do I Have Regarding Use of My Personal Information?</h3>
<p>We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you, provided that such messages are not based on Protected Health Information. You may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the e-mail. Please<br />
note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you e-mails about your account or any Services<br />
you have requested or received from us.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<h3>Children Under 18</h3>

<h2>What is Involved in Inpatient Alcohol Rehab?</h2>
<p>Many people benefit more from inpatient alcohol rehab. Some struggle with more severe alcohol addiction than others require <a title="Mental Health &amp; Dual Diagnosis- Best Behavioral Health Treatment Services" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/mental-health-services/">dual diagnosis</a>, and combined alcohol rehabilitation treatments and therapy for another condition, such as <a title="Tips to Change the Way We View and Treat Severe Depression" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/its-time-to-change-the-way-we-view-and-treat-severe-depression/">depression</a>, for example. Others have experienced withdrawal symptoms in the past. Inpatient treatment provides people with a stable rehab environment, with medical care and support around the clock. Inpatient treatment also gives individuals the advantage of focusing entirely on their recovery, away from the triggers that typically influence them toward drinking.</p>
<h2>What Happens in Residential Alcohol Detox?</h2>
<p>Alcohol detoxification is the necessary first phase of alcohol rehabilitation treatment for people who are at risk of experiencing withdrawal symptoms when they stop using alcohol. Detox is managed by qualified health care professionals, to help maintain medical stability while the body undergoes the process of eliminating alcohol from its system.</p>
<p>The <a title="Residential Inpatient Detox Center in Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/detox-center-utah/">detox treatment professionals</a> may support the process with medications to help ensure safety through withdrawal. Following detox, the individual is transitioned into an alcohol addiction treatment program specifically designed for his or her personal needs.</p>
<p>Common alcohol withdrawal symptoms</p>
<ul>
<li>Tremors</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Rapid heart rate</li>
<li>Heart complications</li>
<li>Delirium (known as DT&rsquo;s)</li>
<li>Seizures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does medically managed detox help?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Medical treatment helps manage the withdrawal process and symptoms safely.</li>
<li>Withdrawal professionals can prescribe medications to minimize the physical impacts of alcohol withdrawal and mitigate intense cravings.</li>
<li>Medical management of withdrawal helps ensure that the individual is physically stabilized and capable of engaging in alcohol rehab treatment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Inpatient Alcohol Treatment (after Detox)</h2>
<p>After completing detox, for a client beginning structured <a title="Why Choose Pathways?- Top Residential Inpatient Drug &amp; Alcohol Rehab Center in Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/why-choose-residential-drug-and-alcohol-rehab/">alcohol rehab treatment</a> in the inpatient rehab setting, there are a variety of therapy frameworks available. Discuss the kinds of services and amenities you want, and they can help you locate a program that is most ideally suited for your particular needs and preferences. In any kind of program, the majority of inpatient alcohol rehab programs can be expected to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-on-One therapy</li>
<li>Medication, if appropriate</li>
<li>Family therapy</li>
<li>Group therapy</li>
<li>Family therapy</li>
<li>Mutual support groups</li>
<li>Aftercare plan</li>
<li>Other therapies</li>
</ul>
<p>Individual therapies focus on learning ways to recognize and deal with causes of stress and triggers for drinking, to help you long-term in avoiding relapse. Therapies will also likely address family dynamics, and any underlying causes of alcohol abuse and help you practice ways of recognizing and making healthier choices. <a title="Group Therapy For Substance Abuse in Utah- Residential Inpatient Rehabilitation Center" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/group-therapy/">Group therapy</a>, facilitated by a <a title="Meet Our Team of Experts- We Are Available 24/7" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/our-team/">licensed therapist</a> guides participants in strengthening sober social skills and practicing relapse prevention skills.</p>
</p><div class="ffb-id-4qjb9k7m fg-paragraph ff-richtext text-left    fg-text-dark">
<h2>How Long Does Inpatient Alcohol Rehab Take to Complete?</h2>
<p>The time lengths for alcohol addiction treatment usually range from those lasting under 30 days to 60-day, or 90-day rehab programs, or longer. The duration of treatment depends on the individual&rsquo;s specific needs. You should only enter a rehab program in a treatment center that offers you a customized rehab program that is tailored to fit your specific situation and treatment needs.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Short-Term Alcohol Rehab</em> &mdash; Short-term rehab treatment may involve a program that is more brief though intensive, for between 3 to 6 weeks of inpatient care, for example. The client then then transitions to <a title="Intensive Outpatient Care Treating Mental Health, Substance Abuse, and Alcohol Abuse" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/outpatient-recovery/">outpatient treatment</a>, including participation in group therapy.</li>
<li><em>Long-Term Alcohol Rehab</em> &mdash; Longer programs can involve 24-hour care over an extended time frame. The treatment may also feature 6 and 12 months of social acclimation therapy, <a title="Glenwood, Utah Family Therapy at Pathways Wholeness Center" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/family-therapy/">family therapy</a>, behavioral therapy, and group therapy, and possibly others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people require detox, followed by a rehab program featuring intensive alcohol abuse therapy, and long-term aftercare.</p>
<p>Data has shown that the majority of people recovering from substance addiction need treatment for a minimum of about 3 months, in order to overcome alcohol abuse behaviors. Research has also shown that staying in treatment for longer periods tends to deliver the best long-term outcomes.</p>
<h2>How Can I Find the Best Alcohol Rehab Program for My Needs?</h2>
<p>Each person has unique needs regarding treatment for alcohol addiction. If a mental health disorder requires additional forms of treatment, a person&rsquo;s rehab needs are more complex. So, predictably, there are numerous types of treatment options in alcohol rehabilitation programs throughout the United States. You&rsquo;re likely to find multiple options in your area. Start by thinking about your priorities in selecting the right alcohol treatment program for your personal needs and preferences.</p>
<p>A key factor in <a title="We Are Available at These Residential Inpatient Locations- Come Visit Us Today" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/location/">choosing a rehab program</a> is deciding whether you prefer to be closer to your home area or want to remove yourself from that area during your rehab period. Some people opt to stay close to home, near family, whereas others prefer to create some distance between themselves and their familiar triggers, for the best head start on a new beginning.</p>

We Can Help!</h2>
<p>Tramadol is a common drug prescribed for the treatment of pain, and this narcotic pain reliever is in the class of drugs called opioid analgesics. While Tramadol is not a natural opioid, it is considered a semi-synthetic opiate. The unfortunate fact is that Tramadol is abused in one-third per 1,000 of prescribed users, accounting for nearly <strong>26,000 overdose trips</strong> to the emergency room in 2010, and still rising today.</p>

<h2>Is Tramadol Addicting?</h2>
<p><strong><em>Yes, Tramadol may be addicting, even at regular doses</em></strong>. In July 2014, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) established Tramadol as a <a title="DEA Classification Change for Tramadol - Tramadol Dependence Treatment in Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery" href="http://medicareinsights.com/2014/07/16/dea-classification-change-for-tramadol/">Schedule IV controlled substance</a> due to clear evidence of possible abuse, dependence, and diversion (a drug that is used for purposes other than its original and legal medical purpose). Those who have a previous history of substance abuse is more likely to become dependent on Tramadol.</p>
<h2>How Addictive Is Tramadol?</h2>
<p>Opioid analgesics like Tramadol are powerful narcotic medications. They act as efficient pain reducers and will generate euphoria at regular dosages; causing a comparable feeling as produced by heroin or Hydrocodone. <strong><em>Tramadol can become extremely habit-forming</em></strong> as it attaches itself to the user&#8217;s brain receptors and modifies the user&#8217;s perception of pain. Additionally, the drug prolongs the actions of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, thus working like an antidepressant.</p>
<p>This dual action of analgesia and antidepressant is what makes this drug highly susceptible to addiction.</p>
<h2>Tramadol Withdrawal Symptoms</h2>
<p>Similar to other <a title="Opiate Addiction Treatment in Utah - Tramadol Dependence Treatment in Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/opiate-addiction-treatment-utah/">opiate addictions</a>, Tramadol will cause unpleasant withdrawal symptoms comparable to Oxycodone or Heroin withdrawal. <strong><em>Common withdrawal symptoms may include, anxiety, mood swings, muscle pain, confusion, headache, depression, headache, restlessness, and diarrhea.</em></strong> It is recommended to taper off Tramadol slowly to minimize the symptoms of withdrawal. Consider that after only a few weeks of taking Tramadol as prescribed, your body becomes chemically altered and establishes a need or craving for the drug. At Pathways Real Life, our <a title="Utah Drug Treatment Programs - Tramadol Dependence Treatment in Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery"  href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/programs/">rehab plans</a> support medically-assisted detox to slowly reduce the opioid intake dosage and taper the patient from dependence to freedom.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><span class="s2">How Do I Know if My Teenager Needs Counseling and Therapy?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Many parents want to know when it’s time for them to get help for their teenager. It&#8217;s hard to know when your teen is just going through normal developmental changes and when they need more help than you can give them. Here are a few signs to look out for that may mean they need <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/teen-rehab-counseling-in-utah/"><span class="s3">extra support and professional engagement</span></a>:</span></p>
<div style="margin-left: 15px;">
<div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">
<ul>
<li><i class="sui sui-chevron-circle-right" style="color:#4d7599"></i> <b>Your teen is using alcohol or drugs:</b> A little experimentation may happen at social events, but when your <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/adolescent-treatment-utah/"><span class="s3">teen is regularly using drugs</span></a> and <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/teen-alcohol-treatment-utah/"><span class="s3">alcohol</span></a>, this could be a sign of addiction or other underlying problems that your teen is struggling with.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-chevron-circle-right" style="color:#4d7599"></i> <b>Your teen is hurting themselves or others or making threats to do so: </b>Violence and self-harm are one way for teens to tell a story. Self-harm and violence are a message that teens are in pain, hurting, feeling helpless, overwhelmed by their emotions or life situations, and don&#8217;t know what else to do.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-chevron-circle-right" style="color:#4d7599"></i> <b>Your teen&#8217;s anxiety or depression is getting in the way of everyday life: </b>Emotions are a normal part of the everyday human experience. However, if your teen has <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/teen-depression-treatment-utah/"><span class="s3">depression</span></a> or <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/anxiety-teens-treatment-utah/"><span class="s3">anxiety</span></a> and their emotions are keeping them from going to school, socializing, or even taking care of themselves and achieving life goals, it&#8217;s time to seek professional help.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-chevron-circle-right" style="color:#4d7599"></i> <b>Your teen is not getting enough sleep: </b>Teens need plenty of sleep to keep up with their growing bodies and minds. There are many reasons why a teen might not be getting enough sleep, such as racing thoughts, internet use or addiction, anxiety, or drug abuse. Lack of sleep can be an indicator of more serious issues.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-chevron-circle-right" style="color:#4d7599"></i> <b>Acting out at school, work, or home: </b>Your child&#8217;s personality seems to have changed overnight. Your sweet, good-natured child is now a <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/adult-teen-adolescent-behavioral-health-clinic-utah/"><span class="s3">defiant teen</span></a> who won&#8217;t attend class, do homework, work, or clean up after him or herself. Arguing, avoiding, yelling, provoking, and even physical violence can indicate a need for psychological help.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-chevron-circle-right" style="color:#4d7599"></i> <b>Home life is becoming very difficult with your teen around: </b>If you and other family members find yourself walking on eggshells when your teen is home, stress levels are very high, and nothing really works, it might be time for an outside intervention. Everyone deserves peace in their home, and if you have exhausted all your resources, it&#8217;s okay to get help.</li>

<h2 class="p4"><span class="s2">What Types Of Therapy and Counseling For Teens Work Best?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Here at <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/"><span class="s3">Pathways</span></a>, we don&#8217;t use a cookie cutter approach with our clients because<b><i> we believe every teen is unique, with different stories, needs, and concerns</i></b>. The following are a few of the research-based treatment modalities that work well with teens in our many years of treating them:</span></p>
<div style="margin-left: 15px;">
<div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">
<ul>
<li><i class="sui sui-chevron-circle-right" style="color:#4d7599"></i> <strong>Individual Counseling:</strong> Individual counseling provides a safe, confidential space for your teen to talk about anything. This gives your teen the time and attention where he or she can explore their life, find healthier coping skills, and learn new tools for thriving.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-chevron-circle-right" style="color:#4d7599"></i> <strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):</strong> Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a solution-focused, goal-oriented approach to changing unhealthy thinking and behavioral patterns.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-chevron-circle-right" style="color:#4d7599"></i> <strong>Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT):</strong> Dialectical Behavioral Therapy has been found to treat a wide variety of problems ranging from depression to bipolar disorder. The main focus is to educate clients about their emotions and how to regulate them.</li>
<li><i class="sui sui-chevron-circle-right" style="color:#4d7599"></i> <strong>Teen Group Therapy:</strong> Research has shown that teen group therapy is a very powerful tool for inspiring change in clients. We all know the impact that peers have on teens. In group therapy, that impact is a positive one, reducing stigma and isolation, and empowering lasting, beneficial change.</li>

You need support that is right for you to help <a href="/relapse-prevention-utah/" title="Substance Abuse Relapse Prevention in Utah -  Pathways Real Life Recovery  - Affordable Outpatient Drug Rehabs"><span class="s4">prevent relapse</span></a>, and you need support to practice the coping strategies that you've learned.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b><i>At </i></b><b><i>Pathways Real Life Recovery</i></b></span></a><b><i> we offer the following choices you can include in your drug addiction aftercare:</i></b></span></p>

<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Individual therapy</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Group counseling</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Outpatient treatment</span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s6"><a href="/sober-living-in-utah/" title="Sober Living Homes in Utah -  Pathways Real Life Recovery  - Best rated Outpatient Drug Rehabs"><span class="s3">Sober living</span></a></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="p5"><span class="s2">Think of these choices as "next steps." These are all options you can choose after you complete rehab. Your recovery specialist will work with you to decide which addiction aftercare plan will continue your recovery and sober living free of drugs or alcohol. You had tasks to complete and milestones to achieve while in rehab. <b><i>Aftercare drug treatment or alcohol treatment will give you skills in the community and at home</i></b>. You can learn from the stories of others in group therapy, and you can learn by practicing sober living skills.</span></p>

<h2>How Will an Addiction Aftercare Plan Benefit You?</h2>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Immediately after you complete your treatment program, you are in early recovery. You don't just run a risk of experiencing relapse triggers, you will encounter them out in the "real world" when you get back to work, family, friends, or other activities. You may also feel bored or lonely, and <b><i>an aftercare plan can </i></b><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/art-and-music-therapy/" title="Art and Music Therapy -  Pathways Real Life Recovery  - General Outpatient Addiction Treatment in Utah"><span class="s4"><b><i>include enjoyable, sober recreation</i></b></span></a><b><i> with other sober people</i></b>. Your aftercare plan will<b><i> help you to avoid situations that could trigger a relapse</i></b>. It will also help you to <b><i>strengthen the skills you need</i></b> to resist urges to relapse.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Addiction aftercare offers you help to reinforce:</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Self-sufficiency</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Life skills</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Self-esteem</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Resilience</span></li>
<li class="li5"><span class="s7"><strong>Fun and enjoyment while substance-free</strong></li>
</ul>

Today, that equals to approximately 23.5 million Americans. People who have suffered from an addiction and <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/help-addict-seek-treatment/">sought help through rehabilitation services</a> <strong><em>have only just begun </em></strong>their journey as a clean and sober individual. <strong><em>Once they leave the privacy and intensive care of a rehab facility, they must learn to adjust to everyday life that can be filled with challenges</em></strong>. Here are 5 tips to help your loved one begin their journey sober, post-rehab.</p>
<h2>1. Adjusting Requires Help</h2>
<ul>
<li>Returning to their lives requires the help of those who are closest, such as friends and family. The stronger their support system, the more likely they will maintain their sobriety.</li>
<li>Knowing there are people to lean on <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/inspirational-addiction-recovery-quotes/">when times are tough</a> gives people battling addiction hope. They know they have people to rely on when they need someone to talk to or to assist them with steps in their recovery.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-4868"></span></p>
<h2>2. Focus On Positive Things In Life</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/5-ways-change-negative-beliefs/">Focusing on positive parts of life</a> and healthy habits can help make the process of recovery much easier. Having something else to focus on is really an excellent method to help adjust right after their rehab.</li>
<li>Taking up new hobbies and doing volunteer work are also excellent options for people who need to fill their calendars with worthwhile activities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Remove Any Drugs And Alcohol From Their Everyday Environment</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you are helping someone with their recovery, you must be sensitive to their issue. Avoid keeping alcohol or drugs around you to remove the temptation that may pose directly after a rehab facility stay.</li>
<li>Sticking to this <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/377841/6-ways-help-someone-recover-after-rehab">plan</a> after the first several months post-rehab will make coping much easier for your loved one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Help Them Join And Attend Support Groups</h2>
<ul>
<li>Encourage them to attend support groups, which can really help a person who may feel like they are alone in their battle. Seeing and talking to others openly about issues that affect victims of addiction can give people the feeling of kinship and understanding they need to tackle daily life with their newfound sobriety.</li>
<li>Offer to give them a ride to and from the meeting to give them the extra push they might need to attend.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Encourage Them To See A Recovery Specialists</h2>
<ul>
<li>After a patient is released from rehab, they will likely require some post-rehab care overseen by an experience recovery specialist or recovery <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/sober-recovery-companion-utah/">coach</a>.</li>
<li>Recovery takes time and effort, and a substance abuse counselor can help make their transition to sober life easier.</li>
<li>Help your loved one keep their appointments and encourage them to continue treatment even if they feel better shortly after release.</li>
</ul>
