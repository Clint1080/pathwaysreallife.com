Depression is more than the usual sadness or moodiness. <em><strong>Specific genetics can make young people more vulnerable to depression, but in most cases, teen depression is triggered by stressful situations such as substance abuse in the family, bullying, divorce, trauma, and or the social settings in a school.<\/strong><\/em> When things go wrong, teenagers tend to react differently. Unrealistic social, family and academic expectations can create a strong sense of rejection among young people which led to deep disappointment that eventually result in depression.<\/p>\n<h2>Types of Teenager Depression Disorders<\/h2>\n<p>It may not be easy to tell when your child is experiencing depression. Some of the common teen depression disorders include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Disruptive Mood\u00a0Dysregulation\u00a0Disorder<\/strong>: Some of the common symptoms of this disorder include aggression, irritability, and frequent physical and verbal resistance. The teen exhibits consistent signs of unhappiness, hopelessness, disinterest, and worthlessness. At this point, the teenager is forced into thinking about suicide.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder<\/strong>: This disorder is mostly associated with the hormonal changes that occur before a menstrual cycle and a few days after the start of menstruation, and they will be gone immediately the period ends.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Major Depressive Disorder<\/strong>: With this type of disorder, the depression can last from the two-week period to several years with frequent\u00a0reoccurrences. The teenager will display a significant change in their mood and loss of interest in some of the activities they considered a hobby. In most cases, the primary depressive disorder is treated as a long-term condition.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Adjustment Disorder<\/strong>: This is short-term and stress-related, and it will mainly occur within three months of an event. Teenagers with this type of disorder will experience poor performance in school, irritable mood, and sleep disturbances. The depression could just be an adjustment from moving to a new town, financial difficulties within the family, break up with a close friend or coping with a divorce of the parents.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Persistent Depressive Order<\/strong>: This type of depressive disorder is sometimes referred to as dysthymia. Although it\u2019s less severe, it is a more chronic form of depression.

However, most of these teenagers didn&#8217;t receive treatment. This shows the importance of recognizing depression symptoms and warning signs in teenagers; otherwise, it&#8217;s most likely that the minor will not receive any help. Knowing the common signs of depression in teens will help a parent identify the problem early enough and take the right steps. Here are the most common symptoms and warning signs of depression among teenagers.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Social withdrawal<\/strong>: Socializing is always one of the critical aspects of any teen&#8217;s life. But if your child&#8217;s social circle has shrunk rapidly, then this may be a clear sign of depression. Although teens may keep some friends even when they are depressed, unlike adults, if there is a rapid reduction in the number of friends the teen is socializing with, then it is a critical warning sign that you should be aware of.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Irritability, Feelings of Hopelessness, and Uncontrolled Anger<\/strong>: The myth that a depressed teen will always be quiet and unconcerned with what is happening around him\/her is untrue. In fact, a depressed teen displays dominant emotions of irritability and anger. In most cases, teens and especially boys, who have been victims of bullying, may become extremely aggressive and violent. Sometimes the minor may also show a pessimistic view of life or the world. Hopelessness is a critical warning sign of depression.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Changes in Their Sleep Patterns<\/strong>: Most teens who are depressed tend to become active at night, and this may push them to a point where he\/she may struggle to wake up for school in the morning. They may also want to do nothing but sleep all day. If you recognize excessive tiredness in your child early in the morning, then ask him\/her if she is having trouble sleeping at night and try to determine the cause of the problem.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Abrupt Loss of Interest in Sports<\/strong>: If your child has been enjoying playing football or participating in athletics but abruptly loses interest in such activities, this could be an indicator that he\/she is stressed. Although changing interests is normal, it has to be gradual and not abrupt.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Becomes Sensitive to Criticism<\/strong>: Although minors tend to display exaggerated reactions to certain situations, being overly sensitive to common criticism is an indicator that the minor is depressed. Being oversensitive could be a sign that your child is feeling low and something is wrong.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Problems at School<\/strong>: Depression can result in low energy and concentration difficulties which may lead to poor attendance and performance at school. Sometimes, a student who has always scored good grades may suddenly start being frustrated with schoolwork.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Low-Self-Esteem<\/strong>: Depression has a way of triggering or intensifying feelings of failure, shame, unworthiness, and ugliness among teenagers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Drug and Alcohol Abuse<\/strong>: When things get worse, affected teens usually turn to drugs and alcohol as a way of self-medicating against the evident effects of depression. However, <a href=\"\/adolescent-treatment-utah\/\" style=\"font-weight:bold\" title=\"Teen Substance Abuse Treatment in Sandy, Utah - How to help a depressed teenager self help in Utah\">substance abuse can only make things worse<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Don\u2019t sit back and relax hoping that the depression will go away with time.\u00a0<a title=\"Request More Information - Teenage Depression and Anxiety in Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/contact\/\">Reach Pathways teen depression specialists<\/a>\u00a0for help any time you discover the above signs in your child.<br \/>&nbsp;<\/br><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Is Your Teen Depressed - Teenage Depression and Anxiety Treatment Center in Utah\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4806 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Is-Your-Teen-Depressed_.jpg\" title=\"Teen Depression and Anxiety Treatment in Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery - How to help a teen with depression\" width=\"417\" height=\"147\" \/><br \/>&nbsp;<\/br><\/p>\n<h2>Suicide Warning Signs to Watch for in Depressed Teenagers<\/h2>\n<p>In most cases, teens who are severely depressed and abuse drugs may decide to commit suicide as a way of solving their problems.
