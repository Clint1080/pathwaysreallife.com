Exactly what\u00a0causes gambling addiction is not clearly defined, but may be the result of a combination of biological and environmental factors. Compulsive gambling can become a progressively serious issue that has potential to destroy lives.<\/p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/govinfo.library.unt.edu\/ngisc\/reports\/fullrpt.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Gambling Impact Study Commission<\/a> (NGISC) gambling addiction affects approximately 2-5% of Americans. Gambling stimulates the brain\u2019s reward system, similar to the effect of drugs or <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/alcohol-treatment\/\">alcohol addiction<\/a>, and this can lead to gambling addiction. Gambling is different from many addictions in that it is defined by whether it causes harm to the gambler or others, rather than on the gambler\u2019s behavior. Because of this, problem gambling is not defined as an addiction but an impulse control disorder.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Adolescent and Teen Gambling<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/adolescent-treatment-utah\/\">Adolescents and teens<\/a> are not immune to developing a gambling problem.
