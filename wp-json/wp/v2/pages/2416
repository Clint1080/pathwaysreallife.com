For recovering addicts, this can be especially useful. People overcoming addiction can often find it hard to get a job due to the negative stigma that has been attached to them. By teaching them a useful skill that they can use in life, it opens up a wealth of possibilities for potential employers.<\/p>\n<p>Living with a disability can be challenging and socially isolating, but gainful employment can help to boost the self-esteem of those with disabilities. Having a good job also helps people with disabilities to play a larger role in their own care. Since the passage of the <a title=\"Americans with Disabilities Act\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ada.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Americans with Disabilities Act<\/a>, disabled people have pushed for more accommodations at work, which can aid in their success. People struggling with disabilities, including those suffering from addictions, can also benefit from a service known as <strong>&#8220;vocational rehabilitation&#8221;<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What is Vocational Rehabilitation?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><em><strong>A vocational school, which may also be called a &#8220;trade school,&#8221; is a higher-level learning institution that helps students build the knowledge and technical skills they need for their career of choice.<\/strong> <\/em><a title=\"Utah Vocational Rehabilitation\" href=\"http:\/\/www.usor.utah.gov\/division-of-rehabilitation-services\/vocational-rehabilitation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vocational rehabilitation<\/a> builds on this concept by offering similar services that have been <em><strong>customized to meet the needs of disabled and addicted individuals<\/strong><\/em>. During vocational rehabilitation, counselors help their clients to reach their physical and mental goals by arranging for the therapy and building the support systems clients need to be successful. Vocational rehabilitation counselors also help clients to thrive professionally by assisting with training and skill building. When clients have completed our rehabilitation program, counselors help them to find and qualify for jobs that are compatible with their skills and abilities.<\/p>\n<h2>Benefits of Vocational and Educational Training<\/h2>\n<p>The biggest change that one must make on the path of recovery is not going down the same roads that lead them to addiction in the first place. The <a title=\"Utah Depression Treatment\" href=\"\/depression-treatment-utah\/\">depression <\/a>and hopelessness that comes along with joblessness can sometimes be a trigger for a <a title=\"Recoverying Drug Addicts Utah\" href=\"\/drug-rehab-sandy-utah\/\">recovering drug addict<\/a> but by giving them a unique set of desirable skills that will make them a valuable asset to any employer, this trigger can be effectively erased.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Vocational Rehab Services\u00a0in Utah<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>At <em><strong>Pathways Real Life Recovery, we work with people who have mental illnesses, psychological disorders or substance abuse problems,<\/strong> <strong>and have graduated from one of our rehab programs, to get into a vocational rehab program<\/strong><\/em>.
