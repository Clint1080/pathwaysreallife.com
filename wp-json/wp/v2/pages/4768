It is a close relative of heroin. Doctors typically prescribe codeine in pill form containing combinations of codeine and over-the-counter analgesics, such as aspirin.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Is Codeine Addictive?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Yes, it is addictive and here is how codeine snares its victims:<\/p>\n<p>Codeine is a prescription drug and a narcotic pain reliever. It works by binding to the body\u2019s opioid receptor in the nervous system and brain. Its major component,\u00a0Hydrocodone, is a synthetic variety of codeine-derived from the opium poppy. It is habit forming and can be highly addictive, especially for those with a history of drug abuse. Codeine can be an escalator drug to mainline heroin use.<\/p>\n<p>Despite its known addictive dangers, doctors write millions of prescriptions for patients for relief of moderate to severe pain. Some people stumble down the road to addiction motivated by pain relief, others because they crave the drug after prolonged use.<\/p>\n<p>Then there are the estimated over 24 million people over the age of 12 who the DEA says have used codeine for non-medical purposes\u2014mixing it with alcohol or marijuana to achieve an enhanced buzz, for example. (Mixing codeine with alcohol can depress breathing to the point of causing coma and permanent brain injury.)<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Signs and Symptoms of Codeine Addiction<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Behavior and appearance: <\/strong>Codeine addiction has observable behavioral symptoms, which include chronic or persistent drowsiness and fatigue, with excessive sleeping. The codeine abuser will complain about itchy skin, nausea, and dizziness. Look for a bluish tint to the lips and fingernails and uncontrolled muscle twitching.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Psychological and mental: <\/strong>Addiction to codeine brings mental and psychological dysfunction. The addicted person is anxious, depressed and experiences hallucinations. Also, look for mood swings, irritability, disorientation and impaired cognitive function, i.e., the inability to solve simple problems.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Social and relationship: <\/strong>Social and relationship impairments that accompany codeine addiction include a breakdown in relationships, increased family unit conflicts, as well as withdrawal from or loss of interest in previously pleasurable activities. The addict will typically request or borrow money, or even steal to support the addiction.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Withdrawal from Codeine Can be Unpleasant<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Codeine withdrawal symptoms include digestive issues such as stomach cramps, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting. Other symptoms include loss of appetite, weakness, headaches, muscle pain, fever and sweating with dehydration.\u00a0 All of those symptoms will combine to cause weight loss, aches, and pains.<\/p>\n<p>The strongest physical withdrawal symptoms from codeine occur in the first few days after the user stops taking the drug. Most symptoms disappear after about two weeks. Behavioral symptoms and cravings can last for months. Those symptoms and cravings can be a further barrier to codeine addiction recovery.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Detox Comes First<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Pathways medical staff professionals employ tested and reliable detoxification methods\u2014prescription drugs, psychological support, etc.&#8211;to help addicted patients through the rough codeine withdrawal symptoms.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>We Provide the Recovery Tools<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Following detox, even when the strong cravings diminish, the recovering person needs the tools to cope with the situations where they previously sought the drug-induced escape and avoidance of life\u2019s struggles.<\/p>\n<p>Your codeine addiction resulted from stresses and experiences, which were personal and unique. Treatment and rehabilitation must be tailored to fix the problem\u2014not in a sterile environment, surrounded by strangers.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/\" title=\"Codeine Addiction Treatment Center in UT - Pathways Real Life Recovery\">Pathways Real Life Recovery<\/a> is a Codeine Addiction Treatment Center<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Pathways outpatient addiction treatment in Utah is a recovery program to help codeine addicts make the behavior changes at home and in the company of family and friends.
