It is often easier to open up to individuals who understand the situation better through their own similar experiences. These sessions provide an environment in which patients will not be morally judged, thus allowing them to confront and fully overcome their addictions. For abusers of psychologically addictive drugs such as cocaine, this type of therapy can be especially effective.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Physical Treatment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Addiction affects both the mind and the body, and at Pathways, we aim to address both aspects. Drug use often begins as an attempt to cope with stress, so it is important to reduce stress as much as possible during treatment. This can be achieved through a variety of methods including massage therapy, acupuncture, exercise, and herbal remedies. Patients can choose a regimen that works for them, and equip themselves with positive ways to eliminate stress from their lives.<\/p>\n<p>These are just a few of the options for drug rehab in Salt Lake City. At Pathways, we recognize the fact that <a title=\"treatment\" href=\"\/our-services\/\">treatment<\/a> is a highly personal matter, and there is no &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; solution to addiction. As a result, we offer treatment that is completely personalized and customize-able, so that patients can choose their own Pathway to recovery.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are numerous approaches to drug rehab in Salt Lake City, depending on the type of addiction, as well as the circumstances of the individual involved.
