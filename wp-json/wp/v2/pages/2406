They may have left it off of their official list of mental illness, but many people in this country know it is all too real. More and more men and women of all ages are showing the same <a title=\"Signs of Drug Use \u2013 Drug Rehab in Sandy, Utah - Pornography Addiction Treatment in Utah - Pathways Real Life\" href=\"\/drug-addiction-signs-drug-rehab-sandy-ut\/\">signs of addiction<\/a> as those with officially recognized addictions to things like gambling and alcohol.<\/p>\n<p>Pornography addiction may seem fun and harmless in the moment, but <em><strong>it has serious, long-term consequences for the addict and their family.<\/strong><\/em> The addiction takes hold of the person&#8217;s mind and body, driving them to indulge in pornography no matter their situation or the possible consequences. These consequences can be far more serious than the embarrassment of getting caught with porn. People have lost their families, jobs, and even faced legal action because of their untreated addiction.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is Pornography Addiction?<\/h2>\n<p>An addiction to pornography is a variation of sexual addiction.\u00a0Pornography addiction is defined\u00a0as \u201cA problematic preoccupation with sexualized imagery that lasts six months or longer and causes significant problems in the user\u2019s life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Pornography Addiction with Pathways Logo - Pornography Addiction Treatment in Utah - Pathways Real Life\" class=\"alignright wp-image-4368\" title=\"Utah Pornography Addiction Treatment\" src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Pornography-Addiction-with-Pathways-Logo-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Keyboard - Pornography Addiction Treatment in Utah - Pathways Real Life\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Pornography-Addiction-with-Pathways-Logo-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Pornography-Addiction-with-Pathways-Logo-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Pornography-Addiction-with-Pathways-Logo-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Pornography-Addiction-with-Pathways-Logo-360x240.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/>The way that porn addiction works\u00a0is\u00a0similar to any other kind of addiction. It starts when an intense stimulation, in this case, an erotic image, causes the brain to release a flood of feel-good dopamine. The person naturally wants to experience that rush again. Unfortunately, their brain is working against them. Over time, it adapts to these surges of dopamine. <em><strong>Longer exposure to more intense forms of pornography is needed to achieve the same &#8216;high&#8217;.<\/strong><\/em> The brain&#8217;s neurochemicals grow so out of balance that attempting to quit leads to withdrawal, physical and emotional &#8216;lows&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>Utah State University has been\u00a0studying the cycle of porn addiction\u00a0for some time now. Researchers there have discovered that, although Utah doesn&#8217;t have higher rates of porn consumption compared to the rest of the nation, many residents of the state experience far more distress from it. Pornography use conflicts with their faith and central values and can have serious social consequences.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, <em><strong>this addiction is all-to-easy to indulge in.<\/strong><\/em> Pornography is\u00a0<a title=\"Covenant Eyes - Pornography Addiction Treatment in Utah - Pathways Real Life\" href=\"http:\/\/www.covenanteyes.com\/2013\/02\/19\/pornography-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a multi-billion dollar industry<\/a>\u00a0that&#8217;s easily and inexpensively available on virtually all forms of media.<\/p>\n<h2>What Are the Signs of Pornography Addiction?<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Viewing pornography for multiple hours a week<\/strong><\/em> and compulsive masturbation, possibly at inappropriate times such as when taking public transportation.<\/li>\n<li><em><strong>Turning to porn when stressed, upset, or bored<\/strong><\/em>; using it as an unhealthy, unproductive crutch to handle unpleasant emotions and life challenges.<\/li>\n<li>Use of <em><strong>porn is interfering with daily life<\/strong><\/em> and responsibilities.<\/li>\n<li>Seeking more intense and &#8216;edgy&#8217; forms of porn as gentler depictions no longer stimulate.<\/li>\n<li><em><strong>Sexual dysfunction<\/strong><\/em> when attempting healthy lovemaking with a caring partner.<\/li>\n<li>Porn use continues despite serious consequences such as damaged relationships or job loss.<\/li>\n<li><em><strong>Emotional distress when attempting to quit porn<\/strong><\/em> coupled with a sense of withdrawal.<\/li>\n<li>Any <em><strong>attempts to quit porn use fail<\/strong><\/em>, often within a few days.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When you read this list, do you recognize yourself or someone you love?
