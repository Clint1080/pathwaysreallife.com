Many people with a dual diagnosis practice self-medication, where they use alcohol or drugs in an attempt to manage anxiety, depression, or other painful emotions. Some combine alcohol or illegal street drugs with prescription medication, dual diagnosis is a broad category with a very wide range, but the defining characteristic is that substance abuse and mental health disorders occur at the same time. Research indicates that working on addiction issues in conjunction with mental health disorders provides successful results.<\/p>\n<p>Pathways Real Life Recovery understands how difficult it is suffering from mental illness and addiction. Our addiction and recovery professionals are here to help ease you or your loved one into a life of sobriety. <strong><em>Call us at <\/em><\/strong><strong><em>801-895-3006 or fill out our <a title=\"Pathways Real Life Recovery - Contact Form\" href=\"\/contact\/\">contact form<\/a>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>to get started with a free addiction and mental-health assessment today.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4322\" title=\"Dual Diagnosis Treatment for Co-occurring Discorders in Utah\" src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/faq-header1.jpg\" alt=\"Dual Diagnosis Treatment for Co-occurring Disorders in Utah\" width=\"850\" height=\"535\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/faq-header1.jpg 850w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/faq-header1-300x189.jpg 300w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/faq-header1-768x483.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Effects of Co-Occurring Disorders<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Although Dual Diagnosis exists in all segments of society, studies have shown that<em><strong> men are more likely to suffer from this condition than women<\/strong><\/em>. It is also more prevalent in those with lower socioeconomic status, people with medical issues, and veterans of the armed forces. <em><strong>Approximately one-third of those with mental illnesses also <\/strong><\/em>participate<em><strong> in substance abuse, with that number increases to 50 percent among people with severe mental health issues<\/strong><\/em>. Those who have experienced traumatic life occupancies that they haven&#8217;t dealt with through therapy may also be at higher risk.\u00a0 Left untreated, those suffering from\u00a0<a title=\"Dual Diagnosis - Learn More\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nami.org\/Learn-More\/Mental-Health-Conditions\/Related-Conditions\/Dual-Diagnosis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dual Diagnosis<\/a>\u00a0often meet with unhappy consequences, including homelessness, alienation from family, friends, and community, prison or jail time, loss of employment, divorce, loss of child custody, overdoses, and even untimely death.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Signs and Symptoms of Co-Occurring Disorders<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Symptoms vary widely among those with a dual diagnosis, but some common characteristics are a withdrawal from family, friends, and social groups such as clubs, organizations, or community activities, an ability to obtain or keep\u00a0gainful\u00a0employment, and increasingly risky behavior such as driving when you&#8217;re intoxicated or otherwise under the influence. Other signs might include feeling as if you cannot function in daily life without relying on the substance in question and doing things that are out of character for the purpose of feeding your habit. An example of this might be using money earmarked to put food on the family table or to pay a utility bill to purchase drugs or alcohol instead. You may also have difficulties developing and sustaining relationships, romantic or otherwise.
