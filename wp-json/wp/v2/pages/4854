Based near Salt Lake City, our treatment approach strengthens and empowers those who come to our Utah facility on their quest for sobriety. <strong><em>Sober living homes provide freedom to resume normal activities such as work or school, while at the same time, being a supportive place to transition back to their normal homes and make sober friends with other residents.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h4>To get more information about Utah sober recovery or our treatment programs, contact Pathways Real Life Recovery at 801-895-3006. We are available 24\/7 to help answer your questions.<\/h4>\n<h2>What Is Sober Living?<\/h2>\n<p><strong><em>Sober living homes are an intermediate environment between rehab and living independently where residents maintain abstinence from drugs or alcohol<\/em><\/strong>. These places used to be referred to as halfway houses and operate as co-living spaces where <strong><em>residents live with others on the same recovery journey<\/em><\/strong>, meaning that there is someone to share meals, someone to talk to, someone to go to meetings with, and this <strong><em>can be a real make-or-break factor to staying sober. Those in sober living homes have already completed a drug or alcohol treatment program and detox; it is a form of ongoing support.<\/em><\/strong> Sober living homes help clients create a new healthy routine outside the strict regiment of inpatient care.<\/p>\n<p>Sober recovery clients pay rent and contribute to housework. Residents may be required to maintain a job, go to school, perform volunteer work, or develop new sober hobbies. Residents\u00a0will observe curfews and participate in random breathalyzer and drug tests three times weekly. When entering our sober living houses, clients agree to follow certain rules and acknowledge there are consequences for not following rules. A case manager works closely with each client to track their progress on a variety of goals.<\/p>\n<h2>How Does the Treatment Process Begin?<\/h2>\n<p>Pathways works with the person suffering from addiction, as well as their family and support network.
