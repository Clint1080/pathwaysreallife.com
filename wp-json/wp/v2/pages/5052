Bisexual women and transgender individuals within the\u00a0LGBTQ+ community are at a higher risk of encountering sexual violence, especially during their childhood.\u00a0According to a 2015 Transgender survey conducted in the U.S., 47% of transgender individuals have been sexually assaulted in their lifetimes.

We can help teens deal with these issues and help them to love themselves for who they are and give them the skills needed to tackle their difficulties in a productive manner.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Self-Esteem: <\/b>The\u00a0LGBTQ+ community faces a special kind of abuse and discrimination.
