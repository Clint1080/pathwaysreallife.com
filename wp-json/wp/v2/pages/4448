It involves having children and parents or caregivers learn how to understand and manage thoughts and emotions associated with trauma. This evidence-based approach integrates more than one treatment approach used for those who have experienced trauma, such as cognitive therapy, behavioral therapy and family therapy. In addition to helping children learn to manage trauma-related emotions, it also helps parents and caregivers learn skills that allow them to support children as they recover. TF-CBT also helps children understand that they are not responsible for the trauma they have experienced.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Domestic Abuse Therapy<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><em><strong>Domestic abuse therapy helps those who have been victims of domestic violence deal with the trauma they have experienced. It is designed for those who have been victims of domestic abuse, as well as those who have witnessed it in the home, such as children<\/strong><\/em>. This type of therapy can include a different approach, such as individual counseling, play therapy or group therapy to help you learn how to manage your emotions in a healthy manner. <strong>Child Trauma Therapy<\/strong> also teaches you how to set boundaries with others and how to recognize signs of abuse. Pathways domestic abuse therapy and child trauma therapist near Salt Lake City provide you and other family members, including children, with a safe place to discuss your traumatic experiences.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Rape and Sexual Abuse Therapy<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Rape and sexual abuse therapy involves different treatment approaches. The type of approach that works most effectively depends on individuals and their experiences with sexual trauma. Some of the types of therapy that are used for rape and sexual abuse include supportive counseling, prolonged exposure therapy, stress inoculation therapy, eye movement desensitization reprocessing and cognitive processing therapy. Some of these, such as stress inoculation therapy, use cognitive behavioral therapy approaches, while others focus more on managing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Prolonged exposure therapy involves having those who have experienced sexual abuse or rape talk about what they have been through several times in order to desensitize them. Supportive counseling, which is typically used shortly after trauma has occurred, involves having a counselor or therapist offer unconditional support.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Pathways Offers Compassionate Trauma Therapy in Utah<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><em><strong>When you need trauma therapy, Pathways is here to help.<\/strong> <\/em>Our skilled counselors, recovery specialists, and therapists work with you to create a customized treatment program based on your needs, rather than having you follow a general treatment plan.
