Anxiety that is ever present and or so intense that it causes <em><strong>preoccupation, feelings of distraction, and tension<\/strong><\/em> in teenagers could be cause to seek treatment. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health condition and can be categorized into different types. In each disorder, the feelings of anxiety occur often and are very strong. The amount of worry is often out of proportion to the situation the teenager is facing. <em><strong>When an anxiety disorder is present it affects a teenager\u2019s daily life and feelings of well-being<\/strong><\/em>.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Overview of Types of Anxiety Disorders<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><strong>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Teens affected by Generalized Anxiety Disorder may worry constantly and feel uneasy or threatened. They may exhibit extremely cautious behavior and suffer from mental exhaustion.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Teens facing <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/5-tips-manage-social-anxiety\/\">Social Anxiety Disorder<\/a> are exhausted by typical everyday social situations. They may have a heightened awareness to criticism and a fear of rejection in social situations.<\/p>\n<p>For more information on how to manage Social Anxiety visit: <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/5-tips-manage-social-anxiety\/\">https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/5-tips-manage-social-anxiety\/<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Panic Disorder\/ Anxiety Attacks<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Panic attacks are usually characterized by rapid heart rate and sweating. Often teenagers who suffer panic attacks will feel like they cannot catch their breath. These symptoms can lead teens to avoid people or situations that trigger the attacks.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Resolving the Problem<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Pathways counselors often treat anxiety in teenagers with a <em><strong>customized treatment plan<\/strong><\/em>. These plans are tailored to the individual needs of each patient. The goal of treatment is to reduce the symptoms by helping teenagers create strategies to control their anxiety. Treatment is determined by the severity and type of anxiety affecting the individual. Psychological counseling is often the first step in identifying a specific anxiety disorder and ways to help a patient cope. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can also be employed to identify the patient\u2019s goals and then focus on helping the patient achieve those goals. CBT therapists will help teenagers achieve their stated goals by helping them <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/negativity-sabotages-success\/\">learn how to think differently<\/a>. They will also <em><strong>listen<\/strong><\/em> to the teenager, <em><strong>teach<\/strong><\/em> them, and <em><strong>encourage<\/strong><\/em> them to express concerns, learn and put therapy strategies into use.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Coping With Anxiety<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Teenagers will learn strategies for coping with their anxiety and lessening their symptoms. Some of the techniques include learning to set aside a few minutes every day to <em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/5-ways-change-negative-beliefs\/\">reflect<\/a> and meditate<\/strong><\/em>. This allows the teenager to identify and lessen sources of anxiety. Another technique is to limit or <em><strong>eliminate substances that aggravate anxiety<\/strong><\/em> including caffeine, drugs, and alcohol. Teens are also <em><strong>encouraged to improve their diet<\/strong><\/em> by not skipping meals and eating at regular times. Teenagers also need to <em><strong>get enough rest<\/strong><\/em> in order to reduce anxiety. Teens may even be encouraged to <em><strong>get involved in community activities<\/strong><\/em> to focus their energy on others instead of their anxiety.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Complications of Untreated Anxiety<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Chronic stress can take a toll on the still-developing body of a teen. A teenager experiencing constant anxiety puts their body under stress and can compromise their immune system. They can become more susceptible to infections such as colds, the flu, and other viral and bacterial diseases. <em><strong>Untreated anxiety can also lead to <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/teen-depression-treatment-utah\/\">depression<\/a>, suicidal thoughts, and <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/connections-between-mental-health-and-substance-abuse\/\">substance abuse<\/a><\/strong><\/em>. Teenagers who do not learn to control their anxiety can be at risk for many harmful side effects if they do not confide in a parent, teacher, or other trusted adult. Counselors at Pathways can help teens identify the <em><strong>sources<\/strong><\/em> of their anxiety and begin an effective treatment plan to help them <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/9-simple-ways-manage-stress\/\">cope with stress<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Anxiety Treatment for Teens in Utah at Pathways Real Life Recovery<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><em><strong>Anxiety in Teens Treatment in Utah at Pathways Real Life Recovery can identify the specific anxiety disorder a teenager may be experiencing.<\/strong><\/em> Once the disorder is identified a counselor can begin a personalized and detailed treatment plan. <em><strong>If left untreated<\/strong><\/em> an anxiety disorder can disrupt a teenager\u2019s life and cause other physical and mental issues to emerge.
