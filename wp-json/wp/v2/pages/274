Addiction can destroy a person\u2019s life physically, emotionally, mentally, financially and spiritually. Although the impact and severity of substance abuse varies from person to person, one thing is certain &#8211; clients need the type of long-term, psychological therapy that we at Pathways offer to break the cycle. We offer a unique approach to substance abuse treatment in Salt Lake City.<\/p>\n<p>Our<\/p>\n<p>Addiction does not discriminate among race, age, gender, creed, or lifestyle. Studies have shown that for a program to be truly effective, it must include a combination of different techniques, as well as individual attention during the process. At Pathways, we understand that there is no &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; solution, and we pride ourselves in our ability to provide our clients with the personal attention they need to get their life back.<\/p>\n<p>Drugs chemically and biologically change brain function even when an addict quits using drugs. This partially explains the compulsion addicts feel to continue using or to relapse, even after significant periods of sobriety. This is why a good foundation early on is a crucial step to achieving lasting success.<\/p>\n<p>In many cases, an individual may be facing multiple issues, such as medical problems, mental health issues, legal problems and social issues. At Pathways, we address these issues\u00a0and provide holistic, natural therapy and <a title=\"treatment\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/why-pathways\/\">treatment<\/a> to equip our clients with the tools they need to work through these issues. We will look at the whole person, not just the addiction, to determine the underlying causes, and work with our clients to resolve these issues. We understand that it is unrealistic to expect clients to overcome an addiction in a few weeks when they have spent years enmeshed in a dysfunctional lifestyle that includes substance abuse.<\/p>\n<p>Because we are all connected to the people around us, we firmly believe that friends, family, and loved ones should be included in the recovery process.<\/p>\n<p>Pathways offers personalized substance abuse treatment in Salt Lake City unlike any other programs out there. If you or a loved one are struggling to cope with an addiction, <a title=\"contact Pathways\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/contact\/\">contact Pathways<\/a> at (801) 867-3550.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What Makes Us Different?
