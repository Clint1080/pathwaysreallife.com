It is an extremely addictive illegal depressant. In fact, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) suggests that approximately 23 percent of heroin users become dependent upon the drug. Other\u00a0NIDA\u00a0statistics reveal that the number of heroin users in the US has escalated, nearly doubling in just the seven year period from 2005 to 2012 (increasing from 380,000 to 670,000).<\/p>\n<p>Heroin rapidly accesses and binds to proteins that function as\u00a0opioid\u00a0receptors on cells in many areas of the brain, especially in regions involved in feelings of pain and pleasure. Other\u00a0opioid\u00a0receptors, located in the brain stem, control processes including breathing, blood pressure, and arousal. The\u00a0opioid\u00a0medications are attractive to users due to their effectiveness in generating a sense of pleasure and well-being by affecting these brain regions involved in feelings of reward.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Various forms of heroin:<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0White or brown powder, or black substance (like tar).<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Methods of use:<\/em><\/strong><em>\u00a0<\/em>Heroin can be used by injecting, smoking, swallowing, or snorting it. The rate at which heroin connects with\u00a0opioid\u00a0receptors in the brain depends upon the method used to take the drug.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Common names for heroin:<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0Heroin has many street names, including Smack, Junk, Horse, Black tar, Skag, Dope, Big H, Brown Sugar. Frequently, heroin is mixed with other substances, such as quinine sugar, starch, or even certain types of poison to enhance the drug&#8217;s effects.<\/p>\n<h2>Health Consequences of Heroin Use<\/h2>\n<p>Long-term use of heroin can lead to severe\u00a0<a title=\"Drug Facts - Drug and Heroin Addiction Treatment - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"https:\/\/www.drugabuse.gov\/publications\/drugfacts\/heroin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">health effects<\/a>, including one or more of the following kinds of diseases, organ damage, or other complications.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Damage to heart, heart lining, heart valves<\/li>\n<li>Damage to veins, and arteries<\/li>\n<li>Slowed breathing<\/li>\n<li>Infections or abscesses (swollen, pus-filled tissue)<\/li>\n<li>Kidney disease<\/li>\n<li>Impeded brain production of chemicals signaling pleasure<\/li>\n<li>Reduced brain cells<\/li>\n<li>Sleep problems<\/li>\n<li>Stomach cramps, constipation<\/li>\n<li>Liver disease<\/li>\n<li>Lung problems, including forms of pneumonia<\/li>\n<li>Infectious diseases (HIV, Hepatitis, or others)<\/li>\n<li>Death<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Heroin Addiction Treatment Process<\/h2>\n<p>A universal approach to heroin addiction treatment does not work for all individuals struggling with heroin addiction. At Pathways, each patient works with therapists, counselors, and other specialists to create a unique treatment program to meet individual needs and goals. Treatment may include the following.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Detox:<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0<a title=\"Detox Center in Utah - Drug and Heroin Addiction Treatment - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/detox-center-utah\/\">Medically managed detoxification<\/a> is the first stage of treatment for recovery from Heroin addiction. Professional detox practitioners, with medical assistance, employ specially formulated medication therapies to simulate some effects of heroin. The medications do not cause patients who have a history of heroin use to experience a sense of altered consciousness or feeling of being high. The medication treatment is utilized during detox to facilitate the process by helping patients feel focused, strong and healthy. The medications are decreased until the patient is no longer taking any replacement medication.<\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Outpatient treatment:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>Treatment may be <a title=\"Outpatient Drug Rehab - Drug and Heroin Addiction Treatment - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/recovery-program\/\">intensive outpatient<\/a> in the beginning. Patients may attend multiple weekly outpatient treatment sessions. After completing the more intensive treatment, out-patients may then transition into a more regular routine of treatments. This involves meeting less frequently and for fewer hours weekly and is focused on helping sustain recovery.<\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - Drug and Heroin Addiction Treatment - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/cognitive-behavioral-therapy\/\">Cognitive-behavioral therapy<\/a><strong><em>:<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0This part of addiction therapy aims at helping a patient first recognize situations in which people in recovery are most likely to become motivated to use drugs, and then learn ways to avoid and cope with those circumstances.<\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Multidimensional family therapy:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>For an adolescent who uses heroin, and for his or her <a title=\"Family Therapy Program - Drug and Heroin Addiction Treatment - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/family-therapy\">family, this form of therapy can be exceptionally useful<\/a> to address a range of potential influences on the pattern of drug abuse. The therapy is designed to help improve the family&#8217;s overall functioning.<\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Motivational interviewing:<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0This treatment is designed to help patients make the very most of their readiness to <a title=\"Behavioral Health Utah, Adult, Teen and Adolescent Clinic - Drug and Heroin Addiction Treatment - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/adult-teen-adolescent-behavioral-health-clinic-utah\/\">change their behavior<\/a>, and to get treatment.<\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Contingency management:<\/em><\/strong><em>\u00a0<\/em>Motivational incentives are employed in this kind of treatment to provide positive reinforcement of the patient&#8217;s recovery efforts and to encourage maintaining abstinence from drugs.<\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Long-term relapse prevention:<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0Continuing preventive treatment is essential to staying drug-free over the long term.

The disease is complex, but it can be successfully treated. It is not necessary for treatment to be voluntary for it to be effective. The most common forms of treatment include counseling, along with other behavioral therapies. Frequently, medications are important for treatment, in conjunction with behavioral therapies. Successful treatment requires acting on the following principles.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>People need ready access to treatment.<\/li>\n<li>Treatment must be individualized to address each patient&#8217;s unique needs.<\/li>\n<li>Treatment must attend to all needs of the patient, not focus only on the drug use issue.<\/li>\n<li>Continuous monitoring of drug use must be maintained during treatment.<\/li>\n<li>As patient&#8217;s needs change throughout treatment, the individual plan must be frequently reviewed and modified.<\/li>\n<li>The patient must stay in treatment for a sufficient length of time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>NOTE:<\/strong>\u00a0Treatment should examine the possibility of other mental disorders that may exist.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, because heroin is an\u00a0opioid\u00a0typically taken by intravenous injection, it is\u00a0<a title=\"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B and C, and Tuberculosis - Drug and Heroin Addiction Treatment - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"http:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/hiv-aids\/basics\/causes\/con-20013732\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">linked<\/a>\u00a0to transmission of communicable diseases such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B and C, and Tuberculosis. Therefore, the treatment program should test addiction patients for these, among other infectious diseases.<\/p>\n<p>Patients should be educated on steps to reduce their risks of contracting these and other blood-borne diseases that can occur as consequences of sharing contaminated needles and other drug paraphernalia, and from high-risk sexual behavior. This education is necessary, as drug abuse can significantly contribute to the potential for these behaviors.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4652\" src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/heroin-drug-treatment.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1304\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/heroin-drug-treatment.jpg 1304w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/heroin-drug-treatment-300x106.jpg 300w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/heroin-drug-treatment-768x271.jpg 768w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/heroin-drug-treatment-1024x361.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1304px) 100vw, 1304px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Pathways Objectives<\/h2>\n<p>The aim of Pathways treatment professionals is to help our clients become free from a sense of shame or guilt that can promote continual self-damaging cycles.
