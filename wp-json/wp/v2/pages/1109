At your first meeting with your counselor, the two of you will develop a custom approach to your recovery and healing that&#8217;s based on your needs and personality. Throughout the course of your sessions, we&#8217;ll work with you to not only get you through the grieving process, but to help you create lasting changes that will improve your well-being and sense of purpose and add greater meaning to your life.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, after your course of therapy has ended, you&#8217;re not just cut off.
