Once assumed to affect only the mind, we now know that depression is a disease that impacts the whole body at the cellular level, generating systemic stress that causes damage to the cells. The research findings have led to much more effective treatment, to alleviate the recurrent emotional and mental distress of depressed individuals and the serious health effects throughout the body.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Phases of depression can last from hours to months, depending on the individual&rsquo;s condition. But, a common indicator of depression is a continued state (two weeks or longer) of sadness or loss of interest in favorite activities. Another gauge for determining the presence of depression disorder is the mal-effects on a person&rsquo;s functioning at their workplace, school, or home, in social situations, and in other everyday interactions.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Symptoms-and-Warning-Signs\">Symptoms and Warning Signs of Depression<\/h2>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Not everyone with depression will feel the same way or will go through the same things; everyone is different. However, many people will feel certain overlapping<em> symptoms when going through depression. These symptoms might include constant or near-constant sadness and feelings of apathy or emptiness<\/em>. You might feel removed from people and situations. You might deal with feelings of guilt, disgrace or worthlessness. You might realize that some of <em>your favorite pastimes and hobbies no longer hold your interest<\/em> like they used to. Furthermore, you might feel low in energy and lethargic &mdash; whether you&rsquo;re over-sleeping or going through bouts of insomnia.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Additional signs and symptoms included in assessments of depression include:<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Poor concentration<\/li>\n<li>Anger, irritability<\/li>\n<li>Sleep difficulties<\/li>\n<li>Fatigue<\/li>\n<li>Appetite changes<\/li>\n<li>Weight loss or gain<\/li>\n<li>Anxiety<\/li>\n<li>Sense of guilt<\/li>\n<li>Feeling worthless<\/li>\n<li>Suicidal thinking<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h4>If you have thoughts of hurting yourself or others, please call <a href=\"tel:+18002738255\" title=\"Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK - Severe Depression Treatment Utah\">1-800-273-TALK (8255)<\/a> anytime 24\/7, and you&#8217;ll be connected to a skilled, trained counselor at a crisis center in your area.<\/h4>\n\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"The-Types-of-Mood-Disorders-Treated\">The Types of Depression Disorders Treated at Pathways<\/h2>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>At <a title=\"Mental Health Counseling and Behavioral Health Treatment Services in Utah - Depression Rehab Center in Utah\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/mental-health-services\/\">Pathways Real Life Recovery<\/a>, our exceptional team of <a title=\"Meet Our Team of Depression Treatment Professionals  - Overcome Depression or Depressive Disorder - Severe depression treatment near Salt Lake City, Utah\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/our-team\/\">depression treatment professionals<\/a> are experienced in successfully treating multiple types of mood disorders, including:<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Major Depressive Disorder<\/em><\/strong> &ndash; also called clinical depression or major depression.<\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder<\/em><\/strong> &mdash; Very violent episodes of behavior that is out of control.<\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Persistent Depressive Disorder (dysthymia)<\/em><\/strong> &mdash; Mild but ongoing state of depression.<\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Bipolar Disorders <\/em><\/strong>&mdash; A chronic condition of extreme highs and lows in moods and energy levels.<\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) <\/em><\/strong>&mdash; Often begins in the fall, worsens in winter, and subsides in the springtime.<\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Cyclothymia<\/em><\/strong> &mdash; A rare condition of highs and lows of mood, though the alternating senses of elation and depression are not as extreme as in bipolar disorders I or II.<\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)<\/em> <\/strong>&mdash; The person has a tendency to worry very frequently without any apparent reasons.<\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Postpartum Depression (PPD)<\/em><\/strong> &mdash; Sometimes occurs in women following childbirth, and can be caused by the body&rsquo;s hormone changes.<\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Others<\/em><\/strong> &mdash; Other types of mood disorders, sometimes due to medication use, illnesses, or other medical causes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h3>Bipolar Disorders and Bipolar Depression<\/h3>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>To better understand depression and depressive disorders, let&#8217;s look at some of the different kinds of depression that you can be diagnosed with. One type of depression is known as <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/bipolar-disorder-treatment-utah\/\" title=\"Bipolar Disorder Treatment near Salt Lake City Utah - Depression Rehab Center in Utah\">bipolar<\/a> depression, and <em>within the spectrum of bipolar depression lies bipolar depression I and II, as well as cyclothymia.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Bipolar depression I<\/em><\/strong> is a disorder characterized by intense mood swings and manic episodes or phases that interfere with your ability to function and interact with people. A manic episode or phase is defined as a time period where you feel high energy and excitement, and it is so intense that it disrupts your normal life. Manic episodes are typically followed by a time period of depression, which is sometimes called a depressive phase.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Bipolar depression II<\/em><\/strong> is not defined by manic episodes or phases for periods of time. Instead, bipolar disorder II is a disorder defined by hypomanic and depressive phases that cycle in and out. Hypomania symptoms include feeling over-confident, excited, energetic and of being talkative, but it is not as severe as full mania.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>The time periods for these cycles and phases can last for hours, days, weeks or months &mdash; it all depends on the person.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Bipolar disorders are a chronic problem with over 3 billion cases per year in the United States alone. Many people with bipolar disorder feel like their normal lives are disrupted, but many may also have successful careers and relationships.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Living with bipolar disorder is a challenging and difficult thing to do. With effective treatment and a good support system, though, you can live life to its fullest and learn how to best manage your symptoms.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h3>Postpartum Depression (PPD)<\/h3>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><em>Postpartum depression (or PPD) is depression that occurs after a mother gives birth<\/em>. There is no one cause or reason for postpartum depression, but psychologists have found that it can be caused by a hormonal change in the body &mdash; as estrogen and progesterone counts both drop after giving birth &mdash; as well as emotional issues such as stress. <em>Postpartum depression symptoms<\/em> include fear that you&rsquo;re not a good mother, irritability, mood swings, depression, feeling overwhelmed, issues with concentration, and problems eating and sleeping. You may also feel difficulty with bonding with your baby.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>PPD can last different amounts of time for everyone. However, if you&rsquo;ve been dealing with the symptoms of PPD for more than just a couple of weeks, it is highly recommended to seek help.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h3>Dual Diagnosis &ndash; Depression and Addiction<\/h3>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>People struggling with depression <em>and<\/em> <a title=\"Substance Abuse Treatment Programs in Utah - Severe Depression Treatment\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/programs\/\">alcohol or drug abuse<\/a> issues fortunately have the choice to get treatment to overcome these conditions and move forward into a free and meaningful life. But, it can be difficult to make the commitment to a program for healing. Pathways designs treatment programs that are customized to address each individual&rsquo;s personal needs. Ours is a holistic approach, treating the whole person, to identify underlying issues that have contributed to depression cycles and substance abuse.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Treatment at Pathways can include administration of antidepressants, to increase serotonin levels in the brain&rsquo;s neurotransmitters. This has the effect of additionally reducing levels of oxidative stress. Such therapeutic medications for depression may be utilized along with addiction treatment, as part of comprehensive treatment in cases of coexisting conditions.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h3>Cyclothymia&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Cyclothymia is a rare disorder that is marked by ups and downs in the mood, but the feelings of elation and depression are not as intense or disruptive to normal life as bipolar disorder I and II. However, the shift in mood is still noticeable, and it is different from the baseline mood.<\/p>\n<p><\/p><\/p><\/div><div class=\"ffb-id-4u5646jf fg-col col-xs-12 col-md-12 fg-text-dark\"><img class=\"ffb-id-4u564ifo fg-image  img-responsive full-width fg-text-dark\" width=\"1200\" height=\"628\" src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Treatment-for-Depression-in-Utah-2.jpg\" alt=\"Group Recovering from Depression - Depressive Disorder Treatment in Utah\" title=\"Utah Depression Rehab and Depression Treatment Center &#8211; Severe Depression Treatment for Teens\"><\/div><div class=\"ffb-id-4u564m2s fg-col col-xs-12 col-md-12 fg-text-dark\"><p class=\"ffb-id-4u5650nu fg-paragraph text-left    fg-text-dark\"><p><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Tips-to-Help-a-Loved-One-Suffering\">Tips to Help a Loved One Suffering from Depression&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to see someone you love suffer with depression or a depressive disorder. It&rsquo;s difficult to know what direction to take, and you don&rsquo;t want to make the situation worse.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Try focusing on these helpful pieces of advice if someone you love is suffering with depression:<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h3>Be an Advocate for Them<\/h3>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Let your loved one know that you will stick by their side &mdash; through both thick and thin. Let them know that you don&#8217;t mind driving them to doctor&rsquo;s appointments or to therapy. If you have questions about anything, ask the doctor. Reassure your loved one that you&rsquo;ll be with them through everything, no matter what that may be. If your loved one knows that you&rsquo;re truly there for them, it&rsquo;ll make all the difference.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h3>Get Educated about Depression<\/h3>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Spending time to learn and research depression and depressive disorders will help you understand what your loved one is going through. Learn about the kinds of treatment they may be getting or could get, and offer your help. Seek to have open, honest discussions with them about treatment and therapy, and what treatment can do for them. <a title=\"Learn About Depression From the Anxiety and Depression Association of America\" href=\"http:\/\/www.adaa.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Learn about depression from the Anxiety and Depression Association of America.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h3>Open the Correct Channels of Communication<\/h3>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re talking to your loved one about treatment, use statements with &ldquo;I&rdquo; as the subject. An example of an &ldquo;I&rdquo; statement is: &ldquo;I think you have some of the symptoms of depression, and because I love and care about you, I think you should consider seeking treatment.&rdquo; Do not force the idea of treatment upon them, but rather open the channel of communication by talking about their feelings &mdash; and listen to what your loved one is saying to you. Don&#8217;t say anything that might come off as being judgmental; simply gently open their eyes to what a treatment program could do for their depression. If your loved one is not ready, say that treatment will always be available.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h3>Make an Appointment<\/h3>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Part of depression can include feeling apathetic towards getting help, which means not taking action to research treatment options.
