These can include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Symptoms and behaviors can include, but are not limited to, the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Utah Drug Treatment Programs - Sexual Abuse Therapy - Pathways Real Life Recovery, Utah\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/programs\/\">Substance abuse and addiction<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Utah Marriage Therapy - Sexual Abuse Therapy - Pathways Real Life Recovery, Utah\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/marriage-therapy-relationship-therapy-Utah\">Trouble forming and maintaining healthy relationships<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Insomnia, sleep disorders, and vivid nightmares<\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Depression Rehab Center - Sexual Abuse Therapy - Pathways Real Life Recovery, Utah\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/depression-treatment-utah\/\">Depression, anxiety and other mental health issues<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>If you notice the warning signs of sexual abuse in a loved one, it is important to seek professional help as soon as possible<\/em><\/strong>. The sooner the healing and treatment process begins, the more the victim will benefit from it.<\/p>\n<h2>Sexual Abuse Therapy Plan in Utah &#8211; Recovery That Goes Deeper Than the Symptom<\/h2>\n<p>Pathways Real Life Recovery believes in treating the whole individual and not just his or her symptoms. Because every person&#8217;s situation is different, we work with every client to create a customized and personalized treatment program. We utilize elements from both child advocacy and the family system approach, which we believe can provide the most effective means of aiding therapy. Our comprehensive program is also <a title=\"Utah Family Therapy - Sexual Abuse Therapy - Pathways Real Life Recovery, Utah\"  href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/family-therapy\">designed to treat all members of the family<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Your personalized care plan will include empirically supported that will be specifically selected to meet your unique needs. Depending on your individual situation, your therapy with Pathways may include the following options:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Utah Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - Sexual Abuse Therapy - Pathways Real Life Recovery, Utah\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/cognitive-behavioral-therapy\/\">Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT)<\/a><strong>:\u00a0<\/strong>CBT is a widely used intervention that helps a patient overcome old, maladaptive ways of thinking about their abuse. As an example, a woman who was abused as a child may avoid developing a healthy romantic relationship, because she assumes all men are abusers. A therapist can work with a person in treatment to identify those types of assumptions and then &#8220;rewrite&#8221; those ways of thinking. CBT has proven to be very effective as a method of short-term therapy for people who are ready and willing to change.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Somatic Experiencing (SE):\u00a0<\/strong>SE is a method which recognizes that humans experience and retain trauma in the body (somatically). Energy can be trapped in the body due to trauma, and when it is not released or discharged, it can lead to anxiety, depression or other symptoms. SE helps a sexual abuse victim to gradually and gently adjust to uncomfortable sensations in the body, which aids in recovery. Typical cognitive therapy requires victims to &#8220;reimagine&#8221; the trauma that they went through; SE, on the other hand, focuses on resolving the physiological symptoms that contribute to other problems.<\/li>\n<p> \t<!--- \n\n<li><a title=\"EMDR Therapy Utah - Sexual Abuse Therapy - Pathways Real Life Recovery, Utah\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaystooele.com\/emdr-therapy-utah\/\">Eye Movement and Desensitization (EMDR)<\/a><strong>:\u00a0<\/strong>An EMDR-certified therapist can help a patient rewire their brain through the use of eye movements, in order to change the way that the mind processes the trauma of childhood sexual abuse. By altering their eye movements, the patient is able to review the abuse, face the trauma and change their physiological reaction to it.<\/li>\n\n  --->\n<\/ul>\n<p>Pathways Real Life Recovery also offers traditional methods such as psychotherapy for PTSD,<a title=\"Utah Art Therapy - Sexual Abuse Therapy - Pathways Real Life Recovery, Utah\"  href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/art-and-music-therapy\/\"> art therapy<\/a>, group therapy, and other treatment options.<\/p>\n<h2>Stages of Sexual Abuse Treatment<\/h2>\n<p>Sexual abuse treatment takes place in three stages:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stage One: Creating a Context for Change.\u00a0<\/strong>A detailed and individualized treatment plan is developed at this stage. A context of safety and hopefulness is created, and family members commit to working toward change. The relationship between patients and the therapist is built to outline the goals of therapy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stage Two:\u00a0Challenging Old Patterns and Expanding New Alternatives.<\/strong>\u00a0The client is aided by creatively challenging maladaptive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Therapeutic interventions are developed based on a client\u2019s strengths. Clients have the option to actively participate in individual, couples, group and family sessions during Stage Two.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stage Three: Consolidation.<\/strong>\u00a0The client takes the newly-developed adaptive behaviors and consolidates them into sustainable methods of ongoing healing. The client will be able to prepare for future challenges.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Sexual Abuse Therapy Setting<\/h2>\n<p><strong><em>Pathways provides <\/em><\/strong><a title=\"Outpatient Drug Rehab - Sexual Abuse Therapy - Pathways Real Life Recovery, Utah\"  href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/recovery-program\/\">outpatient<\/a><strong><em> settings for sexual abuse victims<\/em><\/strong>.
