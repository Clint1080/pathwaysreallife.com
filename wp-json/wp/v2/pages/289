Treatment can often be a frustrating experience, with multiple attempts at recovery before success is achieved. Fortunately, treatment centers can provide extensive programs of therapy that help with the long-standing emotional issues that often lead to substance abuse in the first place. However, not all rehab centers are created equal. Here are some of the most prominent rehab centers in the U.S. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Pathways Treatment Center<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>Pathways, one of the top rehab centers Salt Lake City has to offer,\u00a0takes a unique, holistic approach to addiction treatment. Pathways has been one of the leaders in designing innovative methods that deal with emotional issues relevant to the recovery process. Their \u201cHeal the Heart\u201d program provides counseling in the home, to help patients implement their new coping skills in real-time. In addition, Pathways is one of the few rehab centers in Salt Lake City that offers a completely natural, holistic approach that treats the mind, body, and spirit.<\/p>\n<p> <strong>Promises Treatment Center<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>Promises has two facilities in California; one in Los Angeles and one in Malibu. They are among the most prestigious in the country, with both residential care and extended treatment programs. Their \u201cMalibu Model\u201d programs allow patients to leave the facility more than other programs, which can be helpful for those patients who require periodic time away to attend to career matters or family demands during their treatment period. Many celebrities battling substance addictions have attended Promises Treatment Centers for their high level of patient services. <\/p>\n<p><strong>The Betty Ford Center<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>The Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California was founded by the former First Lady of the United States, Betty Ford, who dealt with her own addiction to <a href=\"\/our-services\/\">alcohol<\/a> and prescription drugs. She founded the facility to deal with the specific problems of women\u2019s addiction and its effects on families and communities. It offers in-patient treatment programs, day programs, family treatment and a recently added pain management program. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Hazelden<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hazelden Treatment Centers were one of the pioneers in the substance abuse treatment, starting with a makeshift treatment facility in a Minnesota farmhouse \u00a0for male alcoholics in 1949. From the beginning, the Minnesota Model offered patients a program based on the 12-step recovery process in an atmosphere of dignity and compassion. Today, Hazelden has centers in Minnesota, Oregon and Florida to provide effective treatment with individual attention and extended care for successful recovery. Addiction can control a person&#8217;s life, but it doesn&#8217;t have to.
