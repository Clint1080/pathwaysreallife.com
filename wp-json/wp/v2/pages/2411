During parent child interaction therapy sessions, a therapist will typically only act as an observer who is shielded from the child&#8217;s view, but will sometimes encourage questions and reactions by remotely coaching the parent through a hidden listening device. Because parent child interaction therapy takes place usually between the ages of two and eight when rapid psychological development is occurring, developmental differences are treated as a baseline of determining appropriate therapy activities between the parent and the child.<\/p>\n<h2>What Children are the Best Candidates for Parent-Child Interaction Therapy?<\/h2>\n<p>Parent-child interaction therapy is thought to be most effective for children who are early in their developmental stages. Therefore, Pathways Real Life Recovery treatment\u00a0centers focus their attention with parent child interaction therapy towards <em><strong>children who are between the ages of two and eight. parent child interaction therapy is designed to help treat children who may be dealing with behavior issues in various aspects of their life, such as school or home, but also daycare<\/strong><\/em>.

Even children who are currently taking behavior-regulating medications can take part in parent child interaction therapy.<\/p>\n<h2>A Closer Look at Parent-Child Relationship Therapy<\/h2>\n<p><em><strong>Parent-child relationship therapy is not one form of therapy alone, but actually involves several different phases.<\/strong><\/em> Each phase involves close involvement between the parent and child, but also a licensed mental health professional. parent child interaction therapy is unique in the fact that it is the only form of therapy that involves treating both the child and parent concurrently, but in order for this to be effective, it must be accomplished in exactness and with only the highest trained professionals. Most parent child interaction therapy treatment plans involve three different phases, each unique in their design, and built to address specific <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/adult-teen-adolescent-behavioral-health-clinic-utah\/\" title=\"Teen and Adolescent Clinic in Utah - Parent-Child Interaction Therapy - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" >behavior issues of the child<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><u>Child Directed Interaction (CDI)<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>During this first crucial phase of parent child interaction therapy, the child takes the lead and the parent basically follows, all under the supervision of a therapist.\u00a0During interaction, the parent is encouraged to use positive communication and reinforcement and just ignore negative behaviors as much as possible. This is accomplished by providing praise, mirroring positive attitudes from the child,\u00a0the child, describing the child&#8217;s behavior in a positive way, and avoiding the use of criticism, questions, and intrusive commands. During phase one, the parent and child interaction is observed discreetly and ongoing sessions usually involve a coach using wireless communication to encourage positive CDI interaction. Not only is the parent coached during the CDI sessions, many times the parent will be given homework and activity assignments to carry over at home.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4344\" src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/parent-child-interaction-therapy-pcit-utah.jpg\" alt=\"parent-child-interaction-therapy-pcit-utah\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Parent-Child Interaction Therapy infographic - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" title=\"Parent-Child Interaction Therapy in Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/parent-child-interaction-therapy-pcit-utah.jpg 600w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/parent-child-interaction-therapy-pcit-utah-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/parent-child-interaction-therapy-pcit-utah-360x240.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong><u>Understanding Parent Directed Interaction (PDI)<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Once a parent has mastered CDI skills, the second phase of parent child interaction therapy training will begin. During this phase, the parent is instructed on how to handle a child&#8217;s negative behaviors effectively by being lead by a secluded therapist through wireless communications. A parent will get to learn new enforcement skills, such as positively stating commands and only offering reinforcement when it is necessary, and they will also learn how to praise a child for being compliant. \u00a0Time-out procedures are often used as reinforcement in phase two if a child refuses to obey, but this is not the immediate repercussion, as steps are encouraged first, like giving a firm warning. Immediately following each session, the parent will be privately given feedback about the session and what they can do to improve. The sessions will continue until the therapist sees that the parent has mastered PDI skills and disruptive behavior at home has lessened to a more manageable degree.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><u>Parent-Child Counseling<\/u><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Parent-child counseling is the final step\u00a0in the usual parent child interaction therapy program. During this phase of treatment, a therapist works with the parent and child directly and parents are taught the fundamentals of the PRIDE acronym to use going forward:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Praise<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; Parents should praise their child&#8217;s positive aspects and attributes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Reflect<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; Parents should reflect on previous behaviors and what their child verbally expresses currently.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Imitate<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; Parents should work to involve themselves with their children by imitating the things that their children enjoy doing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Describe<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; Parents should work to effectively describe the actions of their children.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Enjoyment\u00a0<\/strong>&#8211; Parents should always strive to enjoy any set-aside time they have with their children.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4335\" src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Cute-African-girl-learn-numbers-with-coins-autism-autisitc-math-preschool-building-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Child in Therapy - Pathways Real Life Recovery Utah\" title=\"Parent-Child Interaction Therapy in Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Cute-African-girl-learn-numbers-with-coins-autism-autisitc-math-preschool-building-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Cute-African-girl-learn-numbers-with-coins-autism-autisitc-math-preschool-building-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Cute-African-girl-learn-numbers-with-coins-autism-autisitc-math-preschool-building-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Cute-African-girl-learn-numbers-with-coins-autism-autisitc-math-preschool-building-360x240.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>The Effectiveness of\u00a0Parent-Child Interaction Therapy<\/h2>\n<p>The research into the case outcomes of parent child interaction therapy have proven that this form of treatment can encourage marked improvement.
