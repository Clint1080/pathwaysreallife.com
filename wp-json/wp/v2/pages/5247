is individually identifiable health information which is created or received by or on behalf of a covered entity (for example, a health careprovider or health plan) and which relates to the past, present or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual, the provision of health care to an individual, or the past, present or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual. Protected Health Information is further defined by the federal Health<br \/>\nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and is subject to the protections of HIPAA.<br \/>&nbsp;<\/br><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Additional Health Information&#8221; is a subset of Health Information that does not fall within the category of Protected Health Information above. For example, this would encompass information related to past, present or future physical or mental health or conditions, the provision of health care to an individual, or the past, present or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual but with the difference that such information was not created or received by us from or on behalf of a covered entity. We may collect Additional Health Information in connection with the Site or Applications.<br \/>&nbsp;<\/br><\/p>\n<h3>How We Use and\/or Share Protected Health Information and Additional Health<br \/>\nInformation<\/h3>\n<p>We may use and\/or disclose Protected Health Information and Additional Health Information to provide the Services as described in this policy, except our use and disclosure of Protected Health Information is further limited by the main federal health privacy law known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) and the Notice of Privacy Practices available from your Provider. We will use and disclose Protected Health Information only to provide Services to the Patient or the Provider, for those uses and disclosures permitted by HIPAA, and the agreement that we have with your Provider. In the event that there is a conflict or inconsistency about the handling of Protected Health Information between (i) this Privacy Policy and (ii) our compliance obligations with HIPAA and contractual commitments with Providers, then the latter will govern.<br \/>&nbsp;<\/br><\/p>\n<h3>Non-Personal Information We Collect Automatically<\/h3>\n<p>We may automatically collect the following information about your use of our Site or Services through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies: your domain name; your browser type and operating system; web pages you view; links you click; your IP<br \/>\naddress; the length of time you visit our Site or use our Services; and the referring URL, or the webpage that led you to our Site, and the following: access time, browser type, device ID, domain name, IP address, page views and referring URL.

We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.<br \/>&nbsp;<\/br><\/p>\n<h3>Security of Personal Information<\/h3>\n<p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect Personal Information under our control, and Protected Health Information  specifically, per the HIPAA rules. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at <a href=\"mailto:info@pathwaysreallife.com\">info@pathwaysreallife.com<\/a> .You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.<br \/>&nbsp;<\/br><\/p>\n<h3>Access to My Personal Information<\/h3>\n<p>You may modify Personal Information that you have submitted by logging into your account and updating your profile information. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified or deleted may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Site or Application for a period of time.<br \/>&nbsp;<\/br><\/p>\n<p>You may also contact us directly if you would like to review, correct, update, delete or otherwise limit our use of your Personal Information that has been previously provided to us by sending us a message through <a href=\"mailto:info@pathwaysreallife.com\">info@pathwaysreallife.com<\/a> .

We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that in order to comply with certain requests to limit use of your Personal Information we may need to terminate your account with us and your ability to access and use the Services, and you agree that we will not be liable to you for such termination. Although we will use reasonable efforts to do so, you understand that it may not be technologically possible to remove from our systems every record of your Personal Information. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means a copy of your Personal Information may exist in a non- erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate or remove. We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.<br \/>&nbsp;<\/br><\/p>\n<h3>What Choices Do I Have Regarding Use of My Personal Information?<\/h3>\n<p>We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you, provided that such messages are not based on Protected Health Information. You may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the e-mail. Please<br \/>\nnote that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests.
