It is\u00a0a non 12-step rehab program. Our services are solution and empowerment based. We assist clients to learn to learn to love and value themselves because it is their unhealthy beliefs that lead people into addiction. Lasting alcoholism recovery can only be sustained when the person seeking treatment recognizes their own personal value and then chooses to make it a priority. Pathways gives\u00a0clients the tools to realize their self-worth and see that they don\u2019t need alcohol to cope with their problems. By helping them to see that they have value in this world, it opens up the doors for them to make a conscious decision to change. Pathways also help them to build and repair the relationships that were harmed by their addiction and puts a support system in place that effectively eliminates the triggers and thoughts that would drive them to use in the first place. By taking a whole life approach to treatment, Pathways ensures that after achieving sobriety for a short time, the client is not immediately put back into the situation that led them to addiction in the first place. We develop personalized treatment programs to assist individuals to learn to restructure their unhealthy beliefs, and our clients to do more than just recover \u2013 they learn to thrive. Our caring staff uses evidence-based methods to build confidence and enable clients to regain control of their lives and <a title=\"SMART Recovery.org Tools for Addiction Recovery - Alcohol Treatment Center in Utah - inpatient alcohol rehabilitation\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smartrecovery.org\/smart-recovery-toolbox\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">alcohol addiction<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Alcohol Rehabilitation Method in Our Utah Treatment Center<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Recovery is not just for individuals, but for families. Rather than take a person suffering from alcohol addiction out of their home and putting them in a sterile treatment center, Pathways does healing therapy in the comfort of your own home. The whole family or group is encouraged to be involved in order to facilitate healing their own heart, as well as help the family member receiving treatment. Families will learn how to empower their loved one versus enable them, and reduce the consequences of being co-dependent. This allows not only the person suffering from alcohol addiction to receive support in their every-day environment, but allows the whole family to receive the guidance and training needed to sustain long term change. Family involvement greatly improves therapy outcomes for those suffering alcohol addiction. Your family becomes a support network that does not end when your treatment at our Utah alcohol treatment facility does.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Here are some suggestions to make the transition from a family dealing with alcohol abuse to a family in recovery easier:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 15px\">\n<div class=\"su-list\" style=\"margin-left:0px\">\n<ul>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i> <strong>Expect ups and downs<\/strong> \u2013 Alcohol recovery is a learning process that recognizes and accepts the inevitability of human fallibility, and necessitates those seeking recovery to learn from their mistakes and apply that knowledge to future processes and decisions.<\/li>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i> <strong>Keep your home alcohol free <\/strong>\u2013 The absence of alcohol in the home will help eliminate the chance of relapse.<\/li>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i> <strong>Take care of each other <\/strong>\u2013 Many things from hunger, anger, loneliness, and even being tired may trigger an alcohol craving.
