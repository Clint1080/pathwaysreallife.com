Meth affects the striatum of the brain, an area of great necessity to your memory and body movement.\u00a0 It takes away the individual&#8217;s need for sleep, at least the body&#8217;s regular sleep requirements to function well. The meth abuser can do an unusual amount of activity at one stretch of time without resting; in effect staying awake and hyperactive far past what is normally possible.\u00a0 Meth does this by affecting the dopamine in your brain&#8217;s striatum, dramatically reducing the dopamine&#8217;s binding to its dopamine transporters.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Crystal Methamphetamine<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Crystal meth is methamphetamine in a crystalline form.\u00a0It powerfully affects the body&#8217;s central nervous system and is a stimulant with incredible addictive qualities.\u00a0Some of its alternate names are crystal, glass, ice, and shards.<\/p>\n<h2>Signs of Methamphetamine Abuse<\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re attempting to determine whether a friend or loved one has become a meth abuser, there are some physical signs to search for.\u00a0Signs of methamphetamine abuse include the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Small quantities of white powder, crystals, or syringes<\/li>\n<li>Small, crumpled pieces of aluminum foil<\/li>\n<li>Soda cans that have a hole in their sides<\/li>\n<li>The remains of ball-point pen shafts, used for inhaling the drug through the nose<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The Warning Signs of Meth Abuse<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A meth abuser&#8217;s physical appearance will change.\u00a0 Some of these changes are highly noticeable.\u00a0They include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Skin Picking<\/strong>: The effects of picking their skin in an obsessive-compulsive manner leave what may appear to be an excessive case of acne.\u00a0 Open, &#8220;popped&#8221; sores may appear to be pimples at first glance.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Complaints of Skin Crawling<\/strong>: This is known as formication, which means basically that the abuser feels their skin crawling, literally, and may often complain of such.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Tooth Loss and Decay<\/strong>: This condition is known also as &#8220;meth mouth.&#8221;\u00a0 It refers to just what it sounds like, the deterioration of the teeth to an unpleasant level.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Loss of Hair<\/strong>: The meth abuser is ingesting an extreme amount of unusual chemicals.\u00a0 This along with the lack of proper nutrition experienced by this behavior results frequently in noticeable hair loss.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If meth is abused over a period of time, other symptoms may come into play, some more obvious than others, yet all of them quite serious.\u00a0 These symptoms include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Addiction<\/li>\n<li>Loss of memory<\/li>\n<li>Aggressive behavior &#8230;
