Doctors prescribe the medication to treat <a title=\"Anxiety Treatment - Xanax Addiction Treatment in Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery\"  href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/anxiety-treatment-utah\/\">anxiety and panic disorders<\/a> because it reduces some of the activity of nerve cells in the brain to calm the patient down. The effects are almost immediate and can last up to six hours.<\/p>\n<p>People sometimes use\u00a0Xanax\u00a0recreationally for its sedative effects, and teenagers often have access to a parent\u2019s prescription. \u00a0This type of unauthorized use can easily lead to addiction, but even those using\u00a0Xanax\u00a0as a doctor prescribed can become addicted to the medication. Tolerance typically builds up over time, and the person doesn\u2019t realize they\u2019re addicted until it\u2019s too late. Anyone can become addicted to\u00a0Xanax, but the right treatment program can help you break your addiction.<\/p>\n<h2>Signs of\u00a0Xanax\u00a0Addiction<\/h2>\n<p>Xanax\u00a0addiction can look different in different people. Of course, the signs of addiction can go well beyond these physical symptoms. Often, people who are addicted to\u00a0Xanax\u00a0become socially withdrawn, preferring to stay in and take\u00a0Xanax\u00a0rather than going out with friends and family. The forgetfulness caused by the drug can mean forgotten social events and promises, which can lead to tension among friends.<\/p>\n<p>The problems also start to spill into work. With the physical drowsiness and difficulty concentrating, work performance starts to slip. An addicted person might miss an important deadline or skip work altogether. Some people even lose their jobs.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the most common physical symptoms are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lack of coordination<\/li>\n<li>Feeling drowsy<\/li>\n<li>Sleeping for extended periods of time<\/li>\n<li>Memory problems or difficulty concentrating<\/li>\n<li>Headaches<\/li>\n<li>Nausea<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re seeing these problems in yourself or in a loved one, you know that it\u2019s time to make some changes.
