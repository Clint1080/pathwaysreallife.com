We effectively treat different types of mood disorders including:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s4\"><b>Major depressive disorde<\/b>r \u2013 also referred to as clinical or major depression, this type of mood disorder is characterized by long periods of unexplained extreme sadness, desperation, and\/or fatigue that could last for at least two weeks. While it could be triggered by certain illnesses or life events, one could develop depression without a specific trigger. A person who has a history of depression is likely to experience more episodes in the future.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s4\"><b>Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)<\/b> \u2013 this is a mild, but an ongoing type of depression. Dysthymia is characterized by bouts of depression or irritability that could last for as long as two years.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s4\"><b>Bipolar disorders<\/b> \u2013 this is a mental health issue whose symptoms include extreme lows and highs in a person\u2019s mood and energy. These abrupt shifts can negatively impact the victim\u2019s life. Bipolar disorder can have either manic or depressive symptoms. Manic symptoms include excessive restlessness, energy, activity, racing thoughts, rapid talking, irritability, a euphoric feeling, and so on. Bipolar disorder can be further classified into Bipolar I disorder and Bipolar II disorder.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s4\"><b>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)<\/b> \u2013 this is a depressive disorder that has a seasonal pattern. For most people, SAD symptoms start during the fall and intensify during the winter. The symptoms include a general feeling of lethargy and moodiness, which could develop into a depression during the spring and early summer.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s4\"><b>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)<\/b> \u2013 this is a type of mood disorder where the victim tends to worry a lot for no apparent reason. This condition normally develops if a person cannot cope with internal stress. In some instances, it could be a side effect of certain substances or drugs. GAD is diagnosed if you are constantly worrying for at least six months.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s4\"><b>Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder <\/b>\u2013 this is a common mood disorder in children below the age of 18. It is characterized by episodes of extremely violent and uncontrollable behavior.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li5\"><span class=\"s4\"><b>Others<\/b> \u2013 other forms of mood disorders are caused by medical conditions, illnesses, medications, or drug use and abuse. For instance, persons with terminal diseases such as cancer can experience bouts of depression. Also, people with drug use disorders expose themselves to toxins which could bring about mood disorders.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Mood Disorder Treatment Center in Utah<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">Mood disorders are now recognized as real medical conditions.
