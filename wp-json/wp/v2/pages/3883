The support system around them needs to be solid while the entire person is treated. Many programs are flawed due to their philosophy of only treating the addiction, and not the cause of the addiction. In addition, <strong>a <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/family-roles-addiction-drug-rehab-therapy-sandy-utah\/\">family support system<\/a> and involvement is essential for an effective rehabilitation<\/strong>. <\/p>\n<h2>Treat the Whole Person<\/h2>\n<h3>Successful rehabilitation must include self discovery.<\/h3>\n<p>Unemployment is one of the leading <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/drug-addiction-signs-drug-rehab-sandy-ut\/\">causes of addiction<\/a>. However it isn&#8217;t the only one. The following are also top causes: <\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><div class=\"su-list\" style=\"margin-left:0px\">\n<ul>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i>  Witnessing violence<\/li>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i>  Enduring trauma<\/li>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i>  Poverty<\/li>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i>  Lack of social skills<\/li>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i>  Poor parenting skills<\/li>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i>  Low levels of education<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div><\/div>\n<p>As you can see, there are a wide variety of reasons. Normally, when a person is addicted they are covering one of these up and trying to remove themselves from dealing with them. For example, someone who is living in poverty could be using their alcoholism to escape the fact they don&#8217;t have that much money. By staying in that state of inebriation, they feel as if they don&#8217;t have to deal with the true problem at hand, which is their finances. <\/p>\n<p><strong>A good rehabilitation program will try to work with this person to figure out what is the underlying issue<\/strong>. With the current example, if they were to get this person a job and help them keep their finances on track it would probably lead to rehabilitation of the addiction. A program that does not offer this sort of rehabilitation should be avoided by the addict. If not, there is a higher chance of relapse due to the stress when returning to the outside world. <\/p>\n<h2>Building a Support System<\/h2>\n<h3>Support for continued addiction prevention.<\/h3>\n<p>The last thing an addict needs is to be alone. A strong support system needs to be set onto which the addict can rely on through this difficult time. Once the rehabilitation has begun, the addict will find it easy. However, towards the middle stages it will become tougher and tougher to stay afloat. This is where <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/articles\/family-counseling-in-salt-lake-city\/\">family matters the most<\/a>. <strong>Encouraging the addict to continue and helping them with the difficulty will ensure a proper rehabilitation and a less likely chance of relapse<\/strong>. <\/p>\n<p>For a high quality support system, the home should be free of any temptations. It&#8217;s a sanctuary that the addict can return to after their work and outside life. It&#8217;s where they feel safe from the substance that caused their addiction in the first place. A loved one&#8217;s commitment to the process has been shown to improve the chances of full rehabilitation. There are <a href=\"\/family-therapy\">family therapy programs<\/a> that teach what to do in case of a possible relapse and in other situations. A more knowledgeable household will take a huge burden off of the recovering addict. <\/p>\n<p>Overall, when looking for a rehabilitation program, <strong>pay attention to the process<\/strong>. It&#8217;s a good idea to go with one that treats the addiction and the underlying problem as a whole. An added bonus would be if they educate the family so that they can help the addict outside of the facility. It&#8217;s a difficult task, but it&#8217;s one that can be done with the right people and commitment.<\/p>\n<h2>Pathways Real Life Recovery<\/h2>\n<h3>Come get help today!<\/h3>\n<p>At Pathways Real Life Recovery, we focus on complete recovery.
