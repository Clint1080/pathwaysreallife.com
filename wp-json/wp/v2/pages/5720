It often manifests in cutting, but can also include other behaviors such as self scratching, self-biting, and headbanging.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>How Do You Know If Your Teen Needs a Self Harm Treatment Center?<\/h2>\n<p>There is no test that can diagnose whether your teen has NSSI, and while some who are suffering from this will ask for help, that can be quite rare. Usually, it is family or friends who need to spot the signs in order to intervene and get help, here&#8217;s what to look for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scars, especially in patterns<\/li>\n<li>Frequent injuries<\/li>\n<li>Fresh cuts, scratches, bite marks or bruises<\/li>\n<li>Always wearing long sleeves and pants, including in hot weather<\/li>\n<li>Burns, either from fire or excessive rubbing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em><strong>Patterns of behavior that oftentimes co-occur with NSSI include difficulties and conflicts with interpersonal relationships, impulsive and unpredictable behaviors, as well as overall instability of emotions and behavior, and expressing feelings of worthlessness and helplessness.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Why Do Teenagers Self-Harm?<\/h2>\n<p>This is a complicated question, and as there are a wide variety of mental health conditions that can contribute to engaging in NSSI, there is no simple answer. However, <em><strong>NSSI behaviors can often be triggered by distress.<\/strong><\/em> When a teen self harms they will oftentimes feel momentary calmness. This is only temporary relief and it does nothing to mitigate the dangerous effects of their self-injuring. Teens can also escalate the scale of their injuries, and there is a correlation between NSSI and suicide attempts. Because there are such a wide array of mental illnesses that can be contributing to NSSI, it&#8217;s so important to get the help your teen needs through a qualified mental health professional.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Choose Pathways for Video Game Addiction Treatment in Utah?<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Financing and <a href=\"\/network-providers\/\">Insurance Payment Options<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/inpatient-drug-and-alcohol-rehab\">Inpatient<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"\/outpatient-recovery\/\">Outpatient Treatment<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Evidence-based programs unique to each client<\/li>\n<li>Find REAL solutions<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.legitscript.com\/websites\/?lookup_type=website_search&amp;website=pathwaysreallife.com&amp;product=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Legit Script Certified<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/contact\">Pathways team is available 24\/7<\/li>\n<li><strong>Free Assessments<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Professional Teenage Self-Harm Treatment at Pathways Real Life Recovery in Utah<\/h3>\n<p>Teenage self-harm is a dangerous behavior that can lead to serious injury or even death.
