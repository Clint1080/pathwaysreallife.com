It belongs to the class of <strong><em>sedatives hypnotics<\/em><\/strong>.\u00a0Ambien\u00a0functions by impacting the unbalanced brain chemicals among those fighting insomnia. Upon administration, it slows the brain activity bringing a calming and relaxing effect such that the users can sleep soundly.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Is\u00a0Ambien\u00a0Addictive?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong><em>Yes, prolonged administration of\u00a0Ambien\u00a0causes a relatively average level of addiction<\/em><\/strong>.
