Among the most demanding and confusing to experience is grief. Grief can manifest itself in many ways, but generally is described as a deep sensation of sadness, especially after loss. <em><strong>Grief looks and feels differently for each person. Crying, screaming, yelling, withdrawing, isolating or creatively expressing one\u2019s grief are just some of the ways feelings are processed<\/strong><\/em>. Further still, some people are not sure of what they need. Their behavior may seem erratic and unpredictable. They may prefer the company of friends, or withdraw completely. No matter the expression of grief, it is important to know that help is always available. If you are experiencing symptoms of loss that are affecting your life, counseling might be a good fit to help find the answers.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4402 aligncenter\" title=\"Grief Trauma Bereavement Counseling Utah - Grief Counseling in Salt Lake City, Utah - Pathways Real Life\" src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/grief-trauma-bereavement-counseling-utah.jpg\" alt=\"Grief Trauma Bereavement Counseling Utah - Grief Counseling in Salt Lake City, Utah - Pathways Real Life\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/grief-trauma-bereavement-counseling-utah.jpg 600w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/grief-trauma-bereavement-counseling-utah-300x158.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Pathways Real Life Recovery of Utah believes in a tailored approach to bereavement<\/strong><\/em>, meaning that we meet each client where they are, fitting our grief counseling to suit individual and personal needs.

Many people think of grief as a response to losing a loved one, however, loss can take many shapes. Other events that may trigger grief are those less expected, for example, the loss of health, a job, or a beloved pet. Events like divorce, miscarriage, infertility, moving, or being deployed may also trigger grief. Although many people ascribe grief to sad events, typically joyful events, like the birth of a child, for example, may simultaneously cause a grieving over a loss of freedoms, adult conversation, or quality of life shared between couples.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Traumatic Grief<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>With the forms of grief that exists, there is an equal amount of differing types of grief. Although trauma is relative to the person experiencing a traumatic event, its effect on grief is very concrete.<em><strong> Intensely traumatic events such as a violent death, homicide or suicide can trigger a strong form of grieving known as traumatic grief.<\/strong> <\/em>The reaction to these events is further intensified depending on the closeness of a person to the event; for example, if they personally witnessed or were affected by a traumatic event.<\/p>\n<p>Reactions to traumatic grief may include persistent, distressing preoccupation or fixation on the event that led to the loss. This preoccupation can be triggered at any moment, by anything and can be unpredictable, causing a person to focus on the traumatic aspects like the nature of the death, intense focus on the last moments of the deceased, amount of suffering endured, fixation on the severity of a mutilating injury, or obsession with the malicious or intentional nature of the death.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Grief Counseling Techniques<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><em><strong>Since there are many forms of grief, there are also many individualized treatments available<\/strong><\/em>. If your bereavement feels overwhelming or interferes with your ability to function normally, treatment may help you process your loss and begin to live a happy, healthy life once again. Some treatments for grief include the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Medications<\/strong> \u2013\u00a0<em>Symptoms such as sleep disturbance and anxiety, for example, can distract a grieving individual from processing an event. Medications are used to alleviate problematic symptoms in order to allow a person to begin to work at the root of the problem. Common medications prescribed during grief counseling may include antidepressants or mood stabilizers.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Supportive Therapy<\/strong> &#8211; <em>Supportive therapy is a skilled method of empathetically supporting a client by being an attentive outlet for emotions.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Client-Centered Therapy<\/strong> &#8211; <em>During this practice, the therapist takes on a supportive, non-directive role while the client becomes responsible for actively engaging in steps toward healing.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Utah Cognitive Behavioural Therapy - Grief Counselling in Salt Lake City, Utah - Pathways Real Life\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/cognitive-behavioral-therapy\/\"><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)<\/strong><\/a> &#8211; <em>CBT is a skills-based method where the therapist supports the client in learning about individual triggers; \u00a0then works with the client to create a skills-based strategy to address symptoms as they occur.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a title=\"Behavioural Health Utah, Adult, Teen and Adolescent Clinic - Grief Counselling in Salt Lake City, Utah - Pathways Real Life\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/adult-teen-adolescent-behavioral-health-clinic-utah\/\">Dialectic Behavior Therapy<\/a> (DBT)<\/strong> &#8211;\u00a0<em>Similar to CBT, Dialectical Behavior Therapy is a holistic approach which allows a client to observe negative behavioral and thought patterns and integrate skills like meditation to alleviate symptoms<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Utah Art Therapy \u2013 Utah Music Therapy - Grief Counselling in Salt Lake City, Utah - Pathways Real Life\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/art-and-music-therapy\/\"><strong>Art, Music or Writing Therapy<\/strong><\/a> &#8211; <em>For some people, creativity provides an outlet for emotions unachievable through words alone.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Family Therapy<\/strong> &#8211; <em>Family members work together to improve communication and solve problems in a supportive manner.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4403 aligncenter\" title=\"A Bench - Grief Counseling in Salt Lake City, Utah - Pathways Real Life\" src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/grief-counseling-center-utah.jpg\" alt=\"Grief Counseling Center, Utah - Grief Counseling in Salt Lake City, Utah - Pathways Real Life\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/grief-counseling-center-utah.jpg 600w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/grief-counseling-center-utah-300x158.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>When to See a Professional for Grief, Trauma, or Bereavement Counseling<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The grieving process takes many forms and has many effects on quality of life. <em><strong>Severe changes in behavior, intense physical reactions such as sleep and appetite disturbances, or a preoccupation with death and contemplation of suicide may mean it\u2019s time to seek out a professional <a title=\"Looking for Grief Counselling in Salt Lake City? - Grief Counselling in Salt Lake City, Utah - Pathways Real Life\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/articles\/grief-counseling-salt-lake-city\/\">grief counselor in the greater Salt Lake area who can help manage symptoms or make appropriate referrals<\/a><\/strong><\/em>.
