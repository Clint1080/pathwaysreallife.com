A\u00a0person must have experienced a period of either mania or less severe\u00a0hypomania\u00a0to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder. If you are concerned that you may have bipolar disorder, make sure you discuss all symptoms, including manic episodes, with your health care provider. This will help your provider reach an accurate diagnosis.<\/p>\n<p><u><strong>Depressive symptoms may include<\/strong>:<\/u><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Persistent feelings of sadness or worry<\/li>\n<li>Feeling fatigue or lack of motivation<\/li>\n<li>Feelings of hopelessness or pointlessness<\/li>\n<li>Forgetfulness or trouble concentrating<\/li>\n<li>Changes in appetite<\/li>\n<li>Excessive sleep or difficulty sleeping<\/li>\n<li>Thoughts of death or suicide<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><u><strong>Manic symptoms may include<\/strong>:<\/u><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Becoming much more active than usual<\/li>\n<li>Intense feelings of elation or being &#8220;high&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Feelings of agitation or irritability<\/li>\n<li>Feeling like doing many things at once<\/li>\n<li>Thinking or speaking rapidly about numerous things<\/li>\n<li>Difficulty sleeping or not needing to sleep<\/li>\n<li>Engaging in risky behavior<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Bipolar Testing and Diagnosis<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Some people struggle with bipolar disorder for years before they are diagnosed, because the symptoms may be mistaken for other issues. Likewise, a person with several different health concerns, either mental or physical, may be incorrectly diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Therefore, it is very important for a health care provider to consider all symptoms carefully and use several different testing methods to diagnose\u00a0the issue.\u00a0These tests can help discover or rule out other problems and point out related complications to bipolar disorder. A few of these tests include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Physical\u00a0exams<\/strong> and lab tests to identify or rule out possible physical causes of the symptoms<\/li>\n<li><strong>Psychological testing<\/strong>: A health provider talks to you about your thoughts, feelings, and behavior, or asks you to complete a self-assessment or psychological questionnaire; sometimes friends or family members may be asked (with your permission) to provide information about your symptoms or behavior<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mood charting:<\/strong> A health care provider asks you to keep a daily record of your moods, sleep patterns, and other things that can help track symptoms, pinpoint a diagnosis\u00a0and identify proper treatment<\/li>\n<li><strong>Comparing your symptoms with the current criteria for bipolar<\/strong> and other related disorders listed in the\u00a0Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Treatment for Bipolar Disorder<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If your health care provider does make a diagnosis of bipolar disorder,\u00a0there are many different effective treatment options. These methods can reduce the effect that bipolar disorder has on your relationships, your job, and other aspects of your life. In some cases, the<strong><em> treatment may prevent depressive or manic episodes, or may make them less severe<\/em><\/strong>. Even if you still experience the symptoms of bipolar disorder, know that many other people with this condition have been able to manage their symptoms and live happy, fulfilling lives. <strong><em>A combination of disease education, medication, and some form of therapy is often the most effective at helping individuals with bipolar disorder feel better.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><u><strong>Some specific treatments for bipolar disorder include<\/strong>:<\/u><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/person-centered-and-solution-focused-therapy\/\">Individual therapy<\/a><\/strong>: This type of treatment supports, teaches, and guides people with bipolar disorder and their families, and may include <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/cognitive-behavioral-therapy\/\">cognitive behavioral therapy<\/a>, interpersonal therapy, or\u00a0psychoeducation.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/family-therapy\">Family therapy<\/a><\/strong>: With this treatment, experts from Pathways work with you and your family in your own home, holding family sessions that help the patient and family members address the bipolar disorder. These meetings also help the patient and loved ones discuss how the mental illness has affected the family or household overall, and what emotions have accompanied it. This type of treatment is especially helpful for combating the social isolation that often arises in individuals with bipolar disorder.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Medication management<\/strong>: This may include prescription\u00a0mood stabilizers,\u00a0antipsychotics, antidepressants, antianxiety medications, or some combination of these. Many different medications have demonstrated effectiveness in treating bipolar disorder. Pathways also provides a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/genetic-testing\/\">genetic testing service that can help pinpoint the most effective medication for your specific needs, along with the proper dosage<\/a>. The appropriate medication and dosage is especially important for patients with\u00a0severe depression or thoughts of suicide, as it can help stabilize their moods.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lifestyle changes<\/strong>: Although they\u00a0are not often effective on their own, lifestyle changes can supplement other forms of treatment and help patients feel better. This includes exercise, including swimming or yoga, and plenty of sleep. Some vitamin deficiencies, such as vitamins B and D, can worsen the symptoms of mood disorders.\u00a0Alcohol and other addictive substances should be avoided. Surrounding yourself with supportive people also helps combat depression and feelings of loneliness or isolation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>Pathways Real Life Recovery is a Bipolar Treatment Center in Utah<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong><em>Reaching out for help with bipolar disorder can be intimidating, but seeking\u00a0assistance from a program may save\u00a0your life<\/em><\/strong>. While many people with a mental illness avoid help because they think their problem is &#8220;not that bad,&#8221; living without proper treatment for a long time can have a negative and even dangerous effect. Individuals with bipolar disorder who do not receive\u00a0treatment can slowly lose their ability to\u00a0function normally. During a depressive episode, they may feel worthless and do not want to participate in any activities. During a manic phase, they may spend money recklessly or\u00a0engage in other risky behaviors.<\/p>\n<p>At Pathways, clients first meet\u00a0with an intake counselor for a comprehensive assessment. This will evaluate the client&#8217;s current mental health and the severity of the bipolar disorder, along with other potential medical problems. The multidisciplinary team\u00a0at Pathways will compile the assessment results\u00a0to create an individualized treatment plan, matching each patient with the types of treatment and therapists that are best for his or her specific needs.<\/p>\n<p>Toward the end of treatment at Pathways, patients will work closely with a\u00a0discharge planner to establish a plan for the next phase of bipolar treatment. The experts at Pathways will make\u00a0referrals with people who can form a lasting relationship with the patient and help\u00a0him or her achieve success with\u00a0continued care.<\/p>\n<p>Pathways monitors the progress of our patients for up to 3 years after treatment is completed. <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/contact\/\">Contact Pathways Real Life Recovery today<\/a> for a free assessment opportunity.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is Bipolar Disorder?
