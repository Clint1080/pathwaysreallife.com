Benzodiazepines (benzos) are a class of drugs that affect chemicals in the brain to help return imbalances return to normal. Benzos\u00a0impact the neurotransmitter GABA\u00a0to bring back a balanced state in the body. Benzos\u00a0are psychoactive drugs that function as both an\u00a0anxiolytic\u00a0and anti-epileptic\u00a0medication. Anxiolytics alleviate anxiety and anti-epileptic address seizures. Benzos are classified as depressants for the Central Nervous System. These drugs impact a person&#8217;s cognitive abilities, perception, and mood. <strong><em>It&#8217;s a Schedule IV controlled substance, which means it can only be legally acquired through a prescription<\/em><\/strong>.\u00a0Klonopin\u00a0is quickly becoming one of the most <a title=\"Prescription Drug Abuse Treatment - Klonopin Addiction Treatment in Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/prescription-drug-abuse-treatment-utah\/\">abused prescription medications<\/a> on the market.<\/p>\n<p>Klonopin\u00a0brings about the following effects:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feelings of relaxation<\/li>\n<li>Moderate euphoria<\/li>\n<li>Overall sense of wellbeing<\/li>\n<li>Slower reflexes<\/li>\n<li>Decreased anxiety<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Is\u00a0Klonopin\u00a0Addictive?\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Because of its tendency to result in\u00a0tolerance,<strong><em>\u00a0Klonopin\u00a0is an\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><a title=\"Prescription Drug Abuse Treatment - Klonopin Addiction Treatment in Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery\"  href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/prescription-drug-abuse-treatment-utah\/\"><strong><em>addictive substance<\/em><\/strong><\/a>. Tolerance means that a person must take higher and higher doses to get the same effects. This happens because the body has become used to the foreign substance and adjusts to its presence. Tolerance is often a slow, steady process over a stretch of time using the drug.<\/p>\n<p>Physical dependence to\u00a0Klonopin\u00a0begins when tolerance to the substance reaches its height, and the body no longer knows how to function normally without the substance. Psychological dependence\u00a0to\u00a0Klonopin\u00a0may occur sooner when a person becomes reliant\u00a0on the euphoric properties of the drug.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How Long Does It Take to Get Addicted to\u00a0Klonopin?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The amount of time it takes to become addicted to\u00a0Klonopin\u00a0varies from person to person. Age, sex, and genetic predisposition can potentially affect the timeline for becoming addicted.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Age<\/strong>: When you&#8217;re younger, your brain is still developing, and this makes it easier to become hooked on a drug. You don&#8217;t have as many skills to navigate the drug world, and you presumably have fewer tools to address possible drug tolerance, dependence, and\u00a0addiction. There is evidence to suggest that the elderly\u00a0are at especially high risk for the adverse effects of long-term\u00a0Klonopin\u00a0use.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sex<\/strong>: Studies suggest that drug addiction is more common in males than females. This may be due to the tendency for males to experiment with drugs at an earlier age and their tendency to abuse more frequently in larger amounts.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Genetic Predisposition<\/strong>: The National Institute on Drug Abuse reports that 40% to 60% of an individual&#8217;s susceptibility to addiction is a result of genes. While there are many environmental factors that can set the stage for dependency and addiction, genetic makeup plays a significant role.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>What Are the\u00a0Klonopin\u00a0Abuse Effects?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When a person becomes addicted to\u00a0Klonopin, he or she may develop some telling signs and symptoms of abuse. A person may first appear &#8220;spaced-out&#8221; and have trouble with memory and thought processes. Another red flag is when an individual is repeatedly caught in lies regarding pill use or money spent.<\/p>\n<p>Some signs of\u00a0Klonopin\u00a0addiction include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Defensiveness when asked about use<\/li>\n<li>Memory lapse<\/li>\n<li>Drowsiness through the day<\/li>\n<li>Slurred speech<\/li>\n<li>Impaired reaction times<\/li>\n<li>Taking\u00a0Klonopin\u00a0recreationally<\/li>\n<li>Going to several different doctors to obtain a prescription<\/li>\n<li>Irritability<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Withdrawal Symptoms of Klonopin<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Nausea<\/li>\n<li>Vomiting<\/li>\n<li>Chills<\/li>\n<li>Hallucinations<\/li>\n<li>Seizures<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Pathways is a\u00a0Klonopin\u00a0Addiction Treatment Center in Utah<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong><em>If you&#8217;re looking for a Klonopin addiction treatment center in Utah, check us out<\/em><\/strong> at\u00a0<a title=\"Contact Us - Klonopin Addiction Treatment in Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery\"  href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/contact\/\">Pathways Real Life Recovery<\/a>.
