Since the individual is not the only one affected by drug abuse, it makes sense that the individual should not be the only one treated during the recovery process. At Pathways, we understand that the people we care about are a part of who we are, and we are one of the unique drug <a title=\"addiction\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\">addiction<\/a> centers in Salt Lake City offering counseling for both individuals and family members.<\/p>\n<p>At Pathways, we offer more than just treatment in a clinical setting. We offer personal, custom treatment for our patients in the comfort of their own homes. Rather than addressing whatever current issues are most pressing and sending a patient on their way, we get to the root of the underlying causes of addiction, and give our patients the coping skills they need to face life head on, and live it to the fullest. Our unique approach includes, but is not limited to:<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 15px;\">\n<div class=\"su-list\" style=\"margin-left:0px\">\n<ul>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i> <strong>Caring and professional staff<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i> <strong>Counseling for families and loved ones<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i> <strong>Holistic, natural addiction treatment<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i> <strong>Life coaching for long term success<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>At Pathways, we get to know all of our patients on a personal level, and we truly want to see them succeed. We are not looking for a quick fix that will only last during treatment; we are looking for a lasting solution. In addition, our holistic and natural approach treats both the body and the soul, to revitalize your spirit. We believe that the mind, body, and spirit all all connected, and that lasting success cannot be achieved without maintaining harmony between the three. While the healing process starts by looking within the individual, it certainly doesn&#8217;t end there; that&#8217;s where friends and family come in. Our unique approach includes the loved ones &#8211; the support network &#8211; of the individual to build a solid foundation for real recovery.
