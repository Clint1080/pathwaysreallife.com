But when taken orally it is slower to reach the brain, and therefore produces both a less intense high and less severe withdrawal symptoms.<\/p>\n<p>Since the\u00a01960s, methadone has been used by treatment programs, specifically approved for the purpose, to help many addicts withdraw from heroin.<\/p>\n<h2>Is Methadone Addictive?<\/h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, despite these therapeutic benefits, <em><strong>methadone is chemically like heroin and other\u00a0opioids\u00a0it\u00a0also carries a significant risk of addiction<\/strong><\/em> if it is used for a prolonged period or taken in higher than medically prescribed doses.<\/p>\n<h2>What Are the Symptoms of Methadone Addiction?<\/h2>\n<p>As with any potentially addictive substance, an individual\u2019s neglect of health, family, work or finances may be an early warning sign.\u00a0It is also common for susceptible individuals to display unusual anxiety, particularly at the prospect of access to the drug being removed or restricted. They may also try to hoard additional supplies, perhaps by obtaining them from different doctors or other sources, and may misuse their stock by exceeding the prescribed dose, injecting the drug or combining it with others in an attempt to achieve a more intense high.\u00a0Severe withdrawal symptoms such as shaking, headaches, depression, and digestive disorders such as vomiting and diarrhea may also be a sign that an individual has become addicted.<\/p>\n<h2>How Long Does It Take to Get Addicted to Methadone?<\/h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no simple answer to this question because individuals vary greatly in their physical and psychological responses to methadone.\u00a0Some people, if they adhere strictly to a prescribed treatment regimen, may tolerate its prolonged use without any problem. But individuals who misuse methadone by exceeding the prescribed dose or taking it more frequently than recommended may become addicted within as little as a month or so. Those with a longer history of addiction, or who are also misusing other substances, may display symptoms even more quickly.<\/p>\n<h2>Methadone Rehab Center in Utah<\/h2>\n<p>Safe and lasting withdrawal from methadone, as from any other addictive substance, can be\u00a0very difficult because of the physical and psychological distress which it often involves.\u00a0But at the\u00a0<a title=\"Pathways Real Life Recovery - Methadone Rehab Treatment in Utah\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/\">Pathways Real Life Recovery\u00a0Center of Utah<\/a>, we know from experience that methadone addiction can be successfully treated using carefully planned, personalized treatment programs overseen by qualified\u00a0counselors\u00a0and therapists.<\/p>\n<p>Our Comprehensive Range of Therapies<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Detoxification: <\/strong>This\u00a0program\u00a0involves the careful use of detox tapering medication to minimize the side-effects of withdrawal and the risk of relapse after methadone intake has finally ceased.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Individual and Family\u00a0Counselling: <\/strong>But at Pathways, we understand that medication is only part of the solution. So, we also provide intensive individual\u00a0counseling\u00a0designed to help clients address the underlying psychological and emotional roots of their addiction, rebuild their self-esteem and look forward to a fulfilling future.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Family Therapy:<\/strong> Above all, our emphasis is on the importance of avoiding relapse, and we know that family support is vital if clients are to enjoy long-term freedom from addiction.
