Often,\u00a0<a title=\"Prescription Drug Abuse Treatment in Utah - Oxycodone Rehab Center in Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/prescription-drug-abuse-treatment-utah\/\">Oxycodone\u00a0is prescribed as a pain-relieving drug<\/a>. The prescription is indicated for the management of severe to moderate pain.\u00a0Oxycodone\u00a0is available in immediate releases, in formulas, or in combination with other analgesics, thus the different brand names.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Some of the common brand names include:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>OxyContin<\/li>\n<li>Lortab- Hydrocodone\u00a0and acetaminophen<\/li>\n<li>Percocet- OxyContin and acetaminophen<\/li>\n<li>Percodan- OxyContin, and aspirin<\/li>\n<li>OxyIR and OxyFast-oxycodone immediate release<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Oxycodone\u00a0is synthetically modified from opioid molecules obtained from poppy. Although\u00a0oxycodone\u00a0is fabricated in a lab, it carries similar traits and imparts in a similar way to the other opioids. It shares agonist properties and has a significant effect on the central nervous system, a phenomenon that is associated with the use of morphine and heroin. Also, like any other opioid in the market,\u00a0<strong><em>oxycodone\u00a0can deliver a powerful feeling of &#8220;highness,&#8221; also known as euphoria, thus rendering the drug potential for substance abuse<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Prolonged use of\u00a0oxycodone\u00a0has been associated with the development of tolerance and dependence. And even though heavy opioid users develop a considerable amount of tolerance to the illegal drugs, they do not develop a tolerance towards the lethal side effects of the drugs. Most of them are frequently hospitalized or even die due to the effects of the drugs.<\/p>\n<p>Many individuals who are addicted to Oxycodone began their addiction journey through a legal prescription, only for them to unwittingly become dependent on the drug. Owing to desperation, tolerance levels, and limited access to the\u00a0oxycodone, most of the addicts turn to stronger opioids such as heroin. While the transition from a mundane and health benefiting drug to hardcore opiates might seem absurd, opiate withdrawals can be attributed to the bizarre and incongruous decision.<\/p>\n<h2>Oxycodone\u00a0Addiction Signs and Symptoms?<\/h2>\n<p>There`s a thin line between a responsible use of\u00a0oxycodone\u00a0and\u00a0oxycodone\u00a0abuse. Then, you may ask, how does one know he\/she`s headed to an addiction? In general, <strong><em>one gets addicted to\u00a0oxycodone\u00a0if he starts using the drug in ways not prescribed by a doctor. This is to mean that if you start to take the drug for its effects, rather than the pain purpose, then you`ve crossed the line<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The signs and symptoms of the\u00a0oxycodone\u00a0vary from individuals, depending on their health status, or period of use.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Common signs and symptoms of\u00a0oxycodone\u00a0addiction;<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Depression<\/li>\n<li>Severe weakness<\/li>\n<li>Paranoia<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Common behavioral symptoms<\/strong>;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Social vice such as lying, and stealing<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Doctor Shopping&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Negligence<\/li>\n<li>Strained interpersonal relations<\/li>\n<li>Financial problems<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Common physical symptoms;<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nauseated<\/li>\n<li>Diarrhea<\/li>\n<li>Dry mouth<\/li>\n<li>Respiratory depression<\/li>\n<li>Itching<\/li>\n<li>Dizziness<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Detox for\u00a0Oxycodone\u00a0Withdrawals<\/h2>\n<p>The main benefit of undertaking<strong><em> a detox program is for help in cleansing your body of the lethal toxins from the opiate drug<\/em><\/strong>.
