Conversely, Acetaminophen is a less potent painkiller, but it escalates the effects of\u00a0Hydrocodone\u00a0exponentially. The use of both narcotics is used as pain relievers.<\/p>\n<p>Just like any other class of pain <a title=\"Prescription Drug Abuse Treatment in Utah - Lortab Addiction Treatment in Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/prescription-drug-abuse-treatment-utah\/\">prescription medication,\u00a0Lortab\u00a0is highly abused<\/a>. One of the key factors that lead to the abuse of\u00a0Lortab\u00a0is the addictive nature of one of its major component called\u00a0Hydrocodone.\u00a0Hydrocodone\u00a0is a synthetic variant of codeine-derived from poppy, and it`s highly addictive, particularly for people with a history of drug abuse. Apart from addiction to\u00a0Lortab, it poses a risk factor to future addiction to strong opiates like heroin.<\/p>\n<h2>Signs and Symptoms of\u00a0Lortab\u00a0Addiction<\/h2>\n<p>Abusing\u00a0Lortab\u00a0can lead to physical and physiological dependence. Additionally, misuse of the drug can lead to severe health side effects. However, the effects of the\u00a0Lortab\u00a0significantly vary from one individual to another depending on the level of usage, the health of the dependent, the dosage used, and frequency of abuse. Below are some of the side effects of\u00a0Lortab:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dangerous decreasing breathing rate<\/li>\n<li>Dizziness<\/li>\n<li>Dry mouth<\/li>\n<li>Hallucinations<\/li>\n<li>Severe weakness<\/li>\n<li>Hyperventilation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Behavioral Symptoms of\u00a0Lortab\u00a0Addiction<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Recklessness<\/li>\n<li>Risk taking<\/li>\n<li>Social withdrawal<\/li>\n<li>Paranoia<\/li>\n<li>Secluded behavior<\/li>\n<li>Practicing &#8220;doctor shopping.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Erratic change in mood and behaviors<\/li>\n<li>Engaging in social vices; like stealing, dishonesty, and lying.<\/li>\n<li>Impulsivity<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Lortab\u00a0Withdrawal Symptoms<\/h2>\n<p>Withdrawal from\u00a0Lortab\u00a0is miserable, particularly to those who have developed a total dependency on the drug. The withdrawal process should always be overseen by professional medical personnel to prevent the development of medical complications. Some of the common withdrawal symptoms include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extreme sweating<\/li>\n<li>Body chills<\/li>\n<li>Tremors<\/li>\n<li>Diarrhea<\/li>\n<li>Muscle cramps<\/li>\n<li>Aggression and agitated behaviors<\/li>\n<li>Depression<\/li>\n<li>Pupil dilation<\/li>\n<li>Insomnia<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Detox Services for\u00a0Lortab\u00a0Withdrawals<\/h2>\n<p>Pathways Real Life Recovery understands the need of <a title=\"Detox Center in Utah \u2013 Outpatient Alcohol and Drug Detox Centers in Utah - Lortab Addiction Treatment in Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/detox-center-utah\/\">detox for\u00a0Lortab\u00a0withdrawal service<\/a>, and have partnered with several top Detox centers in Utah that will guarantee detox results when you sign to our\u00a0Lortab\u00a0recovery programs.<\/p>\n<p>A detoxification program is like hitting the reset button for the body.

Suboxone is a popular <a title=\"Opiate Addiction Treatment in Utah - Lortab Addiction Treatment in Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/opiate-addiction-treatment-utah\/\">opiate addiction<\/a> maintenance medication. Suboxone contains naloxone, a substance that prevents users from using\u00a0Lortab\u00a0intravenously.
