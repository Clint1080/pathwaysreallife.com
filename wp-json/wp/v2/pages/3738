Choosing to free yourself from alcohol or drug addiction is a big step toward a fresh start, and we\u2019re here to support you on this journey. We\u2019ll give you personalized tools to stop addiction and add new meaning to your life while rebuilding areas that are broken. Whether you\u2019re searching for information for yourself, a loved one, or have been mandated to participate in a recovery program, Pathways is ready to help. We treat all our patients like they are family and empower them to reach their fullest potential.<\/p>\n<p>If you are just discovering the power of drug rehab, you may have a lot of questions. This guide will walk you through <strong>our philosophy<\/strong>, <strong>what we expect<\/strong> from our patients as they build a clean and sober life, and the <strong>steps you can take to prepare for one of the most life-changing decisions you\u2019ll ever make<\/strong>. Our center takes a holistic approach that <strong>strengthens your body, mind, and spirit<\/strong> as you grow through rehabilitation to ensure enduring success. We are dedicated to your health and help you explore the cause of addiction rather than simply treating the symptoms or behavior. Pathways is a judgment-free center that puts your recovery needs first.<\/p>\n<h2>Do I, Or A Loved One, Really Need Addiction Rehabilitation?<\/h2>\n<p>Recognizing addiction is the first step to recovery. The fact that you\u2019re here, seeking answers, is a great step toward success. If you or a loved one is struggling with alcohol, drug, or behavioral addiction, we invite you to speak with a Pathways advisor to determine whether our treatment is right for you.<\/p>\n<p>Our website also offers a variety of free resources to help you spot the signs of addiction and prepare to take action. We provide <strong>articles<\/strong>, <strong>testimonials<\/strong>, <strong>information<\/strong>, and even a preliminary, <strong>online addiction assessment<\/strong> to help you evaluate your situation. These resources are a wonderful place to start, but should never substitute professional addiction support when breaking free from substance abuse.<\/p>\n<p>Pathways advisors are available via phone or email to answer questions and help you make an informed treatment decision. If you feel that your life or a loved one\u2019s life has become unmanageable due to a dependency on drugs or alcohol, Pathways will help you find the recovery tools you need.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is Pathways&#8217; Drug Rehab Treatment?<\/h2>\n<p>Rehabilitation starts with you. <strong>Pathways simply give you the tools to take back control of your life<\/strong> and stop addictive behavior. We don\u2019t believe in a \u201cone size fits all\u201d treatment model, and work beside you to <strong>build a personalized recovery plan<\/strong> that targets your addiction. Pathways integrates the family to strengthen and repair current issues that may hinder the healing process.<\/p>\n<p>To help you reach your goals, we rely on a multi-systemic recovery approach that leverages psychological counseling, medical treatment, individual or group therapy, spiritual guidance, vocational coaching, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 your dedication to living a sober life to break the cycle of addiction. We know that a single mother of four with a prescription drug dependency needs us to show up in a different way than a college-aged student who is struggling with alcohol and methamphetamine addiction. <strong>Our Master level counselors know how to spot your needs and will coach you through every step of the way<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Recovery can be a challenging process that requires deep commitment and hard work, but rehabilitation treatment ensures you have the support you need no matter what your mindset or physical dependency is.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Pathways?<\/h2>\n<p>At Pathways, we balance cutting-edge medical support, such as hormone and gene testing, with behavioral counseling to<strong> build a spirit of gratitude<\/strong>, <strong>honesty<\/strong>, <strong>action<\/strong>, <strong>integrity<\/strong>, and <strong>service<\/strong> that will bring you or your loved one peace. We understand that addiction is a disease and know how real your struggle can be. <strong>When hope seems lost, Pathways is here to help<\/strong>. Many of our staff and counselors have been where you are now and are living proof of what life can be like free from addiction. Pathways puts you at the center of recovery, providing 24\/7 support to ensure your hard work leads to success.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<div id=\"pagewrap\">\n<header>\n<h2>Drug Addictions Treated at Pathways Real Life Recovery Center<\/h2>\n<div class=\"su-column su-column-size-1-2\">\n<div class=\"su-column-inner su-clearfix\">\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/adderall-addiction-treatment-utah\/\">Adderall<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Alcohol<\/li>\n<li>Ambien<\/li>\n<li>Amphetamine<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/cocaine-addiction-treatment-utah\/\">Cocaine \/ Crack Cocaine<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/prescription-drug-abuse-treatment-utah\/codeine-addiction-treatment-utah\/\">Codeine<\/a><\/li>\n<li>DMT<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/demerol-addiction-treatment-utah\/\">Demerol<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Ecstasy and MDMA<\/li>\n<li>Fentanyl<\/li>\n<li>GHB<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/heroin-addiction-treatment\/\">Heroin<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Inhalants<\/li>\n<li>Ketamine<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/klonopin-addiction-treatment-utah\/\">Klonopin<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Kratom<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/lortab-addiction-treatment-utah\/\">Lortab<\/a><\/li>\n<li>LSD<\/li>\n<li>Marijuana (Cannabis)<\/li>\n<li>Mescaline (Peyote)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/meth-addiction-treatment-utah\/\">Methamphetamine \/ Crystal Methamphetamine<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Morphine<\/li>\n<li>OxyContin<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/oxycodone-addiction-treatment-utah\/\">Oxycodone<\/a><\/li>\n<li>PCP<\/li>\n<li>Prescription Sedatives (Tranquilizers, Depressants)<\/li>\n<li>Percocet<\/li>\n<li>Psilocybin (mushrooms)<\/li>\n<li>Roxicodone<\/li>\n<li>Soma<\/li>\n<li>Synthetic Cannabinoids (spice)<\/li>\n<li>Synthetic Cathinones (Bath Salts)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/tramadol-addiction-treatment-utah\/\">Tramadol<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Valium<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/vicodin-addiction-treatment-utah\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vicodin<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/xanax-addiction-treatment-utah\/\">Xanax<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/rdwWrHGV_M0?rel=0\" width=\"200\" height=\"113\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<aside id=\"sidebar\"><\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<footer>\n<h4>Call 801-981-9503 for a free drug assessment in Utah<\/h4>\n<\/footer>\n<\/header>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Get Help With Pathways Drug Rehab Pathways Real Life Recovery\u00a0represents the power to change.
