Often in rehab, the focus is on an addiction, or even the underlying shortcoming that causes the addiction. Though both are important to understand in order to overcome addiction, <strong>focusing on one&#8217;s strengths is often a more effective way of growing past an addiction<\/strong>. We start with a focus on furthering the development of your strengths as a self-support system after an addiction. Developing these strengths also helps <strong>build confidence and self-esteem<\/strong> which makes facing addiction easier. <\/p>\n<h3>How does strength based rehab work?<\/h3>\n<p>Our strength based services function by <strong>helping the individual to realize his or her own strengths and weaknesses<\/strong>. By encouraging them to find their own strengths, it essentially allows them to evaluate their own self-worth. After identifying their strengths and weaknesses, we can then assist them in helping them to <strong>turn their weaknesses into strengths<\/strong> and using both as tools to encourage long-term sobriety.<\/p>\n<div style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 10px 20px;\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"350\" height=\"197\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/F0ROPQslC-M?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h4>Strengths include:<\/h4>\n<div style=\"margin-left:15px;\"><div class=\"su-list\" style=\"margin-left:0px\">\n<ul>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i>  Good Personal Qualities<\/li>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i>  Successful Hobbies<\/li>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i>  Talents and Skills<\/li>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i>  Environmental Resources<\/li>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i>  Even Good Interests and Apirations<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div><\/div>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Benefits of Strength Based Services<\/h3>\n<p>By <strong>helping people to become strong as individuals, it lessens the need for outside factors such as drugs, alcohol, or gambling.<\/strong> It also establishes a sense of self-confidence that allows them to see that they don\u2019t need drugs or alcohol and that they are better off without those things in their life.
