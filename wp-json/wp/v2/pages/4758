It\u2019s an opioid-type drug that\u2019s typically prescribed to treat severe pain, such as the pain you might have after surgery.<\/em><\/strong> Some doctors prescribe it to treat chronic pain conditions. Vicodin\u00a0works in the brain to change the way the body processes pain. It can create feelings of well-being or euphoria, which can become addictive to those who take it. In 2014, the Drug Enforcement Agency reclassified the medication to Schedule II, making it harder to get. Despite this, use and abuse of\u00a0Vicodin\u00a0are still common.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4759 size-large\" title=\"Caution - Vicodin Addiction Treatment Center in Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Vicodin-Addiction-Treatment-1024x536.jpg\" alt=\"Perscription warning label\" width=\"1024\" height=\"536\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Vicodin-Addiction-Treatment-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Vicodin-Addiction-Treatment-300x157.jpg 300w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Vicodin-Addiction-Treatment-768x402.jpg 768w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Vicodin-Addiction-Treatment.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Is\u00a0Vicodin\u00a0Addictive?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong><em>Yes, Vicodin has highly addictive properties<\/em><\/strong>. Opioids\u00a0like\u00a0Vicodin\u00a0are meant to be taken as prescribed. Most people use them for short periods of time to manage their pain. However, those who like the feeling that the medication creates may begin to misuse their medication. They may take more than the recommended amount or continue to take the medication long after the pain is gone. Soon, they are addicted. Young people are particularly susceptible to\u00a0Vicodin\u00a0abuse. The medication may be easily available in the home, and there\u2019s a perception that prescription pills are \u201csafer\u201d than street drugs. Unfortunately, this is not the case.\u00a0Vicodin\u00a0can cause death when not taken as prescribed or when taken with other medications.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Gateway Drug<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As an opioid,\u00a0Vicodin\u00a0has a similar effect as heroin. Unfortunately, those who have a\u00a0Vicodin\u00a0addiction may struggle with withdrawal when their doctor refuses to prescribe additional pills. Desperate, these people may turn to street drugs like <a title=\"Heroin Addiction Treatment - Vicodin Addiction Treatment Center in Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/heroin-addiction-treatment\/\">heroin <\/a>despite the significant increase in risk.
