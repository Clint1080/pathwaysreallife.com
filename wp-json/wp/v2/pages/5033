Here are a few signs to look out for that may mean they need <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/teen-rehab-counseling-in-utah\/\"><span class=\"s3\">extra support and professional engagement<\/span><\/a>:<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 15px;\">\n<div class=\"su-list\" style=\"margin-left:0px\">\n<ul>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i> <b>Your teen is using alcohol or drugs:<\/b>\u00a0A little experimentation may happen at social events, but when your <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/adolescent-treatment-utah\/\"><span class=\"s3\">teen is regularly using drugs<\/span><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/teen-alcohol-treatment-utah\/\"><span class=\"s3\">alcohol<\/span><\/a>, this could be a sign of addiction or other underlying problems that your teen is struggling with.<\/li>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i> <b>Your teen is hurting themselves or others or making threats to do so: <\/b>Violence and self-harm are one way for teens to tell a story. Self-harm and violence are a message that teens are in pain, hurting, feeling helpless, overwhelmed by their emotions or life situations, and don&#8217;t know what else to do.<\/li>\n<li><i class=\"sui sui-chevron-circle-right\" style=\"color:#4d7599\"><\/i> <b>Your teen&#8217;s anxiety or depression is getting in the way of everyday life: <\/b>Emotions are a normal part of the everyday human experience.
