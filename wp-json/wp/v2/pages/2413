This is a type of talk therapy that focuses on how the way you think affects the things you feel and do. Your thoughts are the primary reason for your actions.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How Does Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Utah Work?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Cognitive-behavioral therapists at Pathways seek to find what the client\u2019s goals are, and then focuses on helping them attain their goals by teaching rational self-counseling skills. <strong>CBT therapists believe that the clients change because they learn how to think differently, and this enables them to act on that learning<\/strong>. In order to obtain the most favorable result possible, the therapist will ask a lot of questions, and even encourage the client to ask themselves a few questions. The CBT therapist has the role is to listen, teach, and encourage, whereas, the client has the role to express concerns, learn, and implement their teachings.<\/p>\n<p>The Cognitive Behavioral\u00a0specialists in our Utah facility\u00a0hit the ground running by identifying the\u00a0needs the substance is satisfying. A person with chronic stress will need different methods than those with depression. This is about teaching personalized coping skills so it&#8217;s crucial that the groundwork be done correctly.\u00a0Say you have an incident, or what CBT professionals would call a <strong>triggering event<\/strong>, in which you are yelled at by your boss; the outcome, or <strong>triggering result<\/strong>, might be feelings of pure inadequacy or possibly anxiety over whether or not you will lose your job. A therapist can address these fears and worries with you. Once the client understands how and why they are doing well, they will know what they need keep doing to continue doing well.<\/p>\n<p>Every CBT session has an agenda, and focuses on the client\u2019s goals. Your thinking, or the cognitive part, will change your actions, or the behavioral part, no matter where you are. <strong>Our Utah Cognitive Behavioral Therapists <\/strong>will not tell the client what their goals should be, but how to unlearn unwanted responses and to learn a new way of thinking. Clients will be given \u201chomework\u201d which will include reading assignments, and to practice their newly learned skills; for example, the client may need to practice deep-breathing exercises to learn to relax or role-playing how to act in certain stressful situations. This homework is VITAL to the success of any CBT care. Clients must practice new thinking skills until they have replaced your old responses. Homework is also an opportunity for clients to try out different skills and pinpoint what works best for them.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3652 size-full\" title=\"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Utah at Pathways Real Life Recovery\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/Utah-Cognitive-Behavioral-Therapy.png\" alt=\"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Infographic\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/Utah-Cognitive-Behavioral-Therapy.png 640w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/Utah-Cognitive-Behavioral-Therapy-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/Utah-Cognitive-Behavioral-Therapy-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/Utah-Cognitive-Behavioral-Therapy-180x180.png 180w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/Utah-Cognitive-Behavioral-Therapy-600x600.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Utah Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Can Help<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Thinking controls almost every situation, which is why the skills taught in CBT are so incredibly important.

The skills training will be to\u00a0remind\u00a0yourself that you have the strength and competency to turn things back around, or that you would find a way to get by should the worst happen and you lose your job. As you\u00a0start to reprogram your brain, you may be surprised at how fast you see results in your actions. Some patients experience a change in as little as 3 to 4 weeks.<\/p>\n<p>Generally, treatment is 1 to 2 times a week for 12 to 16 weeks for those enlisted to our Utah cognitive <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/adult-teen-adolescent-behavioral-health-clinic-utah\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">behavioral care program<\/a>. Treatment may be longer or shorter depending on where you are at, and your commitment to implementing your new, healthy habits. Each individual session is between 50 to 100 minutes. Our therapists don&#8217;t just administer advice during meetings, but also assign you homework so you can challenge thoughts in every situation. These assignments help you determine which strategies work best for you, so you can succeed long after the sessions are over.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>CBT Aftercare in Our Utah Program<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>After your Utah Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is complete, your therapist may recommend 3, 6 or 12 month follow-ups.
