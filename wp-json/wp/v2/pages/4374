Past experiences from childhood, peer-pressure in school, or a strict religious upbringing make up the whole person, even when the parts are somewhat dysfunctional and crippling.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Pathways Real Life - About Us\" href=\"\/about-us\/\">The truth is, our goals can only go as far as our belief systems will allow.<\/a>\u00a0The great news is that self-awareness is a sign that we are ready for progress. Filling the gap between dropping unhealthy belief systems and arriving at true self-awareness is what cognitive behavioral therapy is all about.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What Is A\u00a0Personal Belief System?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>A personal belief system is a set of beliefs you have about yourself&#8211;&#8220;I&#8217;m smart. I&#8217;m fat,&#8221; etc. Provided the positive beliefs are based on reality, the belief system promotes healthy and productive interaction with people and life situations.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, unhealthy beliefs are the ones that lead to the inertia of depression, and attendant problems like overeating. Also, the <strong><em>beliefs are sustained by constant reinforcement<\/em><\/strong> of negative self-talk. For example, returning to the belief that &#8220;I&#8217;m fat,&#8221; is often based on a deeper belief that you are powerless in overcoming temptation and that &#8220;it runs in the family.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Identifying Your Core Beliefs<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-4375\" title=\"Identifying Your Core Beliefs\" src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/bigstock-Thinking-Business-Woman-With-M-60326345-297x300.jpg\" alt=\"Thinking-Woman-Question-Bubbles\" width=\"322\" height=\"325\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/bigstock-Thinking-Business-Woman-With-M-60326345-297x300.jpg 297w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/bigstock-Thinking-Business-Woman-With-M-60326345-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/bigstock-Thinking-Business-Woman-With-M-60326345-768x776.jpg 768w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/bigstock-Thinking-Business-Woman-With-M-60326345-1013x1024.jpg 1013w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/bigstock-Thinking-Business-Woman-With-M-60326345-300x303.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px\" \/>You may smile when you hear an actor playing a\u00a0psychologist in a movie or TV show say to a patient,<br \/>\n&#8220;How does that make you feel?&#8221; However, that question lies at the root in solving the mysteries of what we believe. <strong><em>In short, being aware of our emotions is the critical element.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Take the dysfunctional beliefs that lie at the root of prejudice. When you say, &#8220;I can&#8217;t stand people whose lifestyles are (fill in the blank),&#8221; you are superimposing your belief system on a group of people who neither know you and are not affected in any way by your beliefs.<\/p>\n<p>So what you believe can be a blockade to tolerance and understanding. You will never move forward and become a better, more inclusive person until you recognize that the words, &#8220;I can&#8217;t stand&#8221; are a key to identifying core beliefs, which may not stand up to objective scrutiny. They are based on emotion subjective, irrational emotions are \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0often\u00a0the core of an unhealthy belief system.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Altering An Unhealthy Belief System<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Whatever unhealthy beliefs you have about yourself, you should realize that they are neither permanent, nor impermeable to change. With guidance, practice and application, you can begin to develop positive beliefs about yourself.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Remember that the reason you adopted those unhealthy beliefs is that you are the sum total of your experiences.<\/em><\/strong> Those experiences are the tapes that play over and over in your head and reinforce your belief system.\u00a0Your beliefs, in turn, can either be true or untrue. To the extent they are untrue; they are dysfunctional emotions, which you articulate in terms of your own self-image. They sustain what is and isn\u2019t true about yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Also, since <strong><em>untrue beliefs are crippling rationalizations,<\/em><\/strong> you need to sweep them away and make room for positive changes in your life. Are beliefs such as, &#8220;I&#8217;m too old to learn something new&#8221; keeping you from enrolling in that additional skills training you need? If so, consider the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whatever you think you can\u2019t do, someone just like you in similar circumstances is out there doing exactly what you want to be doing. Why? Because that someone has different beliefs and the positive references of successful experiences that support those beliefs.<\/li>\n<li>It is healthy to be in the habit of questioning your beliefs in order to be constantly evolving and developing new beliefs at the same time. That takes practice and a change in mindset, which may take you out of your comfort zone.<\/li>\n<li>When you take the time to judge whether your beliefs are serving you well, you reward yourself in the best way possible: <strong><em>You eliminate bad or untrue beliefs that no longer serve you.<\/em><\/strong> This house cleaning is\u00a0the first step\u00a0in personal and emotional growth.<\/li>\n<li>We engage in spring-cleaning for our homes; we clean out our desks and closets, and we even cut out people and circumstances in our lives that no longer suit us.
