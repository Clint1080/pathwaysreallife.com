Genetic testing may be the answer you are looking for. Sadly, a lot of doctors just prescribe what the drug companies pay them to for certain conditions. <strong><em>With dozens of medications that treat the same condition, genetic testing evaluates your genetic makeup to determine what prescription and how much of it will be effective for you and your body.<\/em><\/strong> When you are diagnosed with anxiety, depression, bipolar disease, schizophrenia or other related conditions, your doctor considers many different factors to determine the best medication for you. <strong><em>Influences like your age, lifestyle, overall health and other medications are considered when choosing the best treatment.<\/em><\/strong> Unfortunately, most individuals have to <strong><em>endure the lengthy and frustrating process of trying multiple medications before an effective treatment is found<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Through specialized genetic testing called drug-gene testing or pharmacogenomics, our <a title=\"About Pathways Real Life Recovery - Genetic testing or Pharmacogenomic Help - Pathways Real Life\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/about-us\/\">caring team of recovery experts<\/a> will <strong><em>quickly identify the correct medication that will work best with your unique genetic makeup<\/em><\/strong>. Genetic testing is an invaluable service for anyone who takes prescription drugs. It is performed in order to determine the right dosage and what medications work best with your unique genetic make-up. Individuals metabolize drugs slow, medium or fast. Everyone metabolizes drugs differently, and you may metabolize anti-depressants at a fast rate, and antibiotics at a slow to medium rate.<\/p>\n<p>We will personalize a highly-effective treatment plan using your genetic results combined with our holistic treatment options to help you <strong><em>achieve positive life changes for a healthier, happier you<\/em><\/strong>.
