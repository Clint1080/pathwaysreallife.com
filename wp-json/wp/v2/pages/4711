In July 2014, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) established Tramadol as a\u00a0<a title=\"DEA Classification Change for Tramadol - Tramadol Dependence Treatment in Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"http:\/\/medicareinsights.com\/2014\/07\/16\/dea-classification-change-for-tramadol\/\">Schedule IV controlled substance<\/a>\u00a0due to clear evidence of possible abuse, dependence, and diversion (a drug that is used for purposes other than its original and legal medical purpose). Those who have a previous history of substance abuse is more likely to become dependent on Tramadol.<\/p>\n<h2>How Addictive Is Tramadol?<\/h2>\n<p>Opioid analgesics like Tramadol are powerful narcotic medications. They act as efficient pain reducers and will generate euphoria at regular dosages; causing a comparable feeling as produced by heroin or Hydrocodone. <strong><em>Tramadol can become extremely habit-forming<\/em><\/strong> as it attaches itself to the user&#8217;s brain receptors and modifies the user&#8217;s perception of pain. Additionally, the drug prolongs the actions of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, thus working like an antidepressant.<\/p>\n<p>This dual action of analgesia and antidepressant is what makes this drug highly susceptible to addiction.<\/p>\n<h2>Tramadol Withdrawal Symptoms<\/h2>\n<p>Similar to other\u00a0<a title=\"Opiate Addiction Treatment in Utah - Tramadol Dependence Treatment in Utah - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/opiate-addiction-treatment-utah\/\">opiate addictions<\/a>, Tramadol will cause unpleasant withdrawal symptoms comparable to Oxycodone or Heroin withdrawal. <strong><em>Common withdrawal symptoms may include, anxiety, mood swings, muscle pain, confusion, headache, depression, headache, restlessness, and diarrhea.<\/em><\/strong> It is recommended to taper off Tramadol slowly to minimize the symptoms of withdrawal. Consider that after only a few weeks of taking Tramadol as prescribed, your body becomes chemically altered and establishes a need or craving for the drug.
