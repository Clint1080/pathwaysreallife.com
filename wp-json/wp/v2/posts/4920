Drug poisoning deaths in Utah have<strong><em> surpassed<\/em><\/strong> deaths due to other causes such as firearms, motor vehicle accidents, and falls. Misuse of addictive prescription medications such as opioids can result in<strong><em> personal and legal consequences<\/em><\/strong>. <strong><em>It is estimated that 23 Utahns die every month from prescription drug overdoses<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Here is an overdose 101 detailed look at the basics of overdose and <strong><em>what to do if someone overdoses.<\/em><\/strong> Below are some overdose basics to aid in understanding the topic better;<\/p>\n<h2>What is an Overdose?<\/h2>\n<p>A drug overdose occurs when one takes a drug or a combination of different medications above and beyond the prescribed limit. Overdose signs differ with the type of drug used. As such,<strong><em> it is vital to know the right amount and time of taking your medication to avoid an overdose<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Types of Drugs and Signs of Overdose<\/h3>\n<h4>Opioids and Depressants<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/why-is-heroin-so-addictive\/\"><em>Heroin<\/em><\/a> and other pharmaceutical opioids such as <em>Endone<\/em>, <em>benzodiazepines<\/em>, and <em>barbiturates<\/em> produce a calming effect by slowing down the central nervous system. <strong><em>Depressants<\/em><\/strong> <strong><em>slow down the vital activities of the body such as breathing and the heart rate<\/em><\/strong>. These substances can be prescribed to a patient who has a sleeping problem and for purposes of relieving pain. However, <strong><em>when taken in large amounts or mixed they can cause permanent brain damage and overdose<\/em><\/strong>, which will lead to depressing normal body functions such as breathing and eventual slowing down of the heart rate that can result in death.<\/p>\n<h4>Alcohol<\/h4>\n<p>Alcohol is used recreationally to produce a calming effect by slowing down the central nervous system. Although most people don\u2019t consider extreme consumption of alcohol as an overdose, <strong><em>alcohol is a strong depressant<\/em><\/strong> that can lead to an overdose if consumed uncontrollably. For example, <strong><em>binge drinking can lead to acute alcohol poisoning<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h4>Stimulants<\/h4>\n<p>An overdose of stimulants such as <em>amphetamines<\/em> can increase the <strong><em>risk of stroke and seizures.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Tolerance and Half-life<\/h2>\n<p>It is possible to develop tolerance when using a drug regularly. Although a person who has developed tolerance will need more of the drug to get the same effect, he\/she can also lose the tolerance if he doesn\u2019t use the drug for a while. Also,<strong><em> if someone takes the usual amount of prescription medication after a break from using the drug, it could also lead to an overdose.<\/em><\/strong> That is why using drugs after periods of abstinence such as release from prison or after leaving a drug rehab center can cause an overdose.<\/p>\n<p>Half-life is the time it takes for a particular drug\u2019s strength or effect to drop to half of its original dose. Benzodiazepines drugs are known to have a longer half-life. In other words, <strong><em>if an individual used the drug yesterday, he\/she may still have enough in the system to get an overdose, if the same drug is used today<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>Drug Overdose First Aid<\/h2>\n<p>Drug overdose symptoms depend on a range of factors, such as medical history, type of drug used and amount of drug taken. <strong><em>Don\u2019t assume someone who has overdosed is asleep because it can take several hours for someone who has overdosed to die<\/em><\/strong>. This is a medical emergency that necessitates <strong><em><u>immediate medical attention<\/u><\/em><\/strong>.
