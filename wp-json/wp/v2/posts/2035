This is the message that people receive when going through treatment at most rehabilitation facilities. While this is a good message and it is the <a href=\"\/why-pathways\/\">basis of rehabilitation<\/a>, it\u2019s important not to stop the treatment there. There are so many issues at the root of addiction that you cannot simply treat the addiction and walk away.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>How to Approach Rehabilitation<\/h2>\n<h3>Accountability<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s completely normal to hear a rehabilitation facility take credit for helping someone break free of an addiction. It is, however, practically unheard of for a rehabilitation facility to take the blame when it doesn\u2019t go so well. This is a problem that must be addressed. If you can take credit for the successes but not take blame for the failures, then what level accountability are you being held to?<\/p>\n<h3>Find the Root of the Problem<\/h3>\n<p>Treatment should not be all about the addiction. True treatment addresses every portion of a clients\u2019 life and helps them heal and recover all parts of their life. Treating should involve getting to the root of the problem and helping to get a person in the right shape physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially. By doing this, the addiction is being treated as well as the root causes of the addiction.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2037\" src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/imgres.jpg\" alt=\"Utah Substance Abuse Treatment\" width=\"275\" height=\"183\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Don&#8217;t Stop Until the Problem&#8217;s Treated<\/h3>\n<p>If you were to go to a doctor for a runny nose and he simply wiped your nose with a tissue and sent you along on your way, this would not be considered a successful doctor\u2019s visit. The same applies to rehabilitation and treatment; you simply cannot treat the symptom and leave the disease. When this happens, you\u2019re essentially dooming that person to a relapse.<\/p>\n<p>Addiction can be overcome but it starts with the right approach. <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/\">Treating an addiction<\/a> is not as simple as saying \u201cDon\u2019t do drugs anymore.\u201d It has to start with a Whole Life Approach, helping to get their entire life running the right way. The addiction is only a small portion of a bigger issue and must be addressed as such.<\/p><style><\/style><script type=\"text\/javascript\"><\/script>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[ffb_param route=&#8221;o gen text&#8221;]Get clean and stay clean!
