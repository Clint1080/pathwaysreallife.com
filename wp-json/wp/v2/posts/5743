When they make a mistake, they have a higher chance of avoiding trying to learn from this experience. Instead of working toward better outcomes, they might assume that there is nothing they can do to prevent these mistakes from occurring again.<\/p>\n<p>Other people use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologicalscience.org\/news\/releases\/how-the-brain-reacts-to-mistakes.html\" title=\"How the Brain Reacts to Mistakes - Pathways Real Life Recovery - Improving Your Mindset for Addiction Recovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">learning behavior<\/a> to deal with mistakes. If you do this, it means that you tend to see mistakes as learning experiences. <b><i>Rather than giving up after you make a mistake, you typically look for ways to avoid repeating it. <\/i><\/b>Believing that you\u2019re fully capable of dealing with mistakes and other challenges is a healthy mindset to have for improved mental health, whether you struggle with an addiction, depression or another mental health disorder.<\/p>\n<h2>Adjusting Your Mindset for Addiction Recovery<\/h2>\n<p><b><i>Having a mindset that focuses more on growth and change is important when you\u2019re working toward addiction recovery or learning to manage a mental health disorder. <\/i><\/b>If you tend to have more of a fixed mindset, there are ways to adjust it to a growth mindset. This involves doing the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i>Learning to recognize how you react<\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding that you can choose to change your reaction to mistakes or challenges<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding healthier ways to react to mistakes and difficult situations<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making a habit of seeing mistakes and challenges as learning opportunities<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For example, you can learn to recognize whether you see your struggle with mental health problems or addiction as an ongoing issue that you can can\u2019t change or a chance to make changes to your behavior. If you realize that you have a fixed mindset, you can then focus on making the choice to work on recovering from an addiction or managing a mental health problem in healthier ways. Taking these steps can provide you with hope and motivation to improve your well-being.<\/p>\n<h3>Professional Addiction and Mental Health Treatment for a Healthier Mind<\/h3>\n<p>While you can work on changing from a fixed mindset to a more open one, this can be tough to do on your own. Mental health and addiction treatment experts have effective ways to help you adjust your mindset so that you can learn from your mistakes.
