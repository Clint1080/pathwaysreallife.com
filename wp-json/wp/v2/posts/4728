That\u2019s an increase of\u00a0<em>533 percent \u2014\u00a0<\/em>a shocking number.<\/p>\n<p>Naturally, the first question that arises from statistics like these is\u00a0<em>why heroin is so addictive<\/em>? It\u2019s obvious that those who try the drug have trouble getting off of it almost right away. What\u2019s going on?<\/p>\n<p>Before delving into the science of why heroin is so addictive, let\u2019s first discuss what exactly heroin is.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2><strong>What is Heroin?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Like morphine, OxyContin, codeine, hydrocodone, and methadone, heroin is a drug derived from opium. In fact, heroin actually comes from morphine, which itself comes from the seed pod of the opium poppy. Opium poppies grow naturally in countries like Colombia, Mexico, and Southwest and Southeast Asia.<\/p>\n<p>Heroin is an illegal drug, but it is still readily available and sold on the black market. It generally comes as a brown or white powder, but it may also be distributed as \u201cblack tar heroin,\u201d a sticky black substance that is actually black because it is processed improperly and full of impurities.<\/p>\n<p>Heroin is usually injected into the muscles, veins, or beneath the skin, but it can also be sniffed, smoked, or snorted. On the streets, the drug is often called the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Horse<\/li>\n<li>Smack<\/li>\n<li>Hell Dust<\/li>\n<li>Big H<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>The Addictiveness of Heroin<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a title=\"Heroin Addiction Treatment - Why is Heroin So Addictive? - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/heroin-addiction-treatment\/\">Heroin addiction<\/a>\u00a0starts almost immediately after someone uses the drug. In fact, just one or two \u201chits\u201d can set an individual on the road to addiction right away.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because humans already have\u00a0<a title=\"Heroin - Why is Heroin So Addictive? - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"https:\/\/www.drugabuse.gov\/publications\/drugfacts\/heroin\">opioid receptors<\/a>\u00a0in the brain, and remember that heroin is a form of an opioid. When someone takes heroin, the drug enters the brain quickly and binds directly to those receptors. This enhances their power many times over to decrease pain and worry. It also slows down breathing and heart rate.<\/p>\n<p>These short-term effects coincide with a rush of euphoria and contentedness in the user, and all of these seemingly positive effects tell the brain and the body that \u201cheroin is great,\u201d setting in motion severe addictive patterns.<\/p>\n<p>For those with depression, bipolar disorder, or other mental disorders or personal struggles, this is a recipe for disaster. As those struggling with addiction to continue to use heroin on a regular basis, the addiction only grows stronger. Any attempts to stop using the drug result in extremely uncomfortable and painful withdrawal symptoms, making it nearly impossible to stop using the drug without professional intervention and help.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Contact Pathways Real Life Recovery Today<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Are you or a loved one struggling with heroin abuse?
