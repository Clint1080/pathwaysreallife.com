This craziness is one of the reasons why people love celebrities and follow their lives on TV and social media. Quite frankly, stars that are too tame often don\u2019t make the front page or get people talking.  Sometimes, however, celebrity\u2019s actions make news in a very bad way, such as behavior associated with drug use.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Through the years there have been numerous celebrities who have attended rehabilitation facilities and publicly struggled with addiction, such as Charlie Sheen, Whitney Houston, Robert Downey Jr. and Courtney Love. Unfortunately, there are still many stars who are in desperate need of rehab to help them deal with their addiction problems. Read on to learn about 4 celebrities who are in need of rehab.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Amanda Bynes<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Bynes became famous as a teen star and received widespread praise for her clothing line and acting career. Within the last three years, however, Bynes\u2019 behavior began to spiral out of control. In one incident she threw a bong out of the window of her Manhattan apartment, letting it drop over 30 stories. Bynes was also arrested for a DUI and has been engaged in several fights with other celebrities via Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>Amanda was hospitalized this year for mental illness at the University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center. Just recently, her doctors decided to move her from the hospital to a celebrity rehabilitation facility, hoping that the new environment will be more conducive to growth and healing for the star.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Lamar Odom<\/b><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_2104\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2104\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/Lamar_Odom_2012_Shankbone-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Lamar Odom\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-2104\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/Lamar_Odom_2012_Shankbone-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/Lamar_Odom_2012_Shankbone-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/Lamar_Odom_2012_Shankbone-180x180.jpg 180w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/Lamar_Odom_2012_Shankbone-600x600.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2104\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">SOURCE: blacklikemoi<\/p><\/div>\n<p>In 2001 Odom was suspended from the NBA for violating the league\u2019s drug policy, but promised that drugs would not be an issue for him again. That promise didn\u2019t ring true, however, and Lamar has been estranged from wife Khloe for months due to his drug use. According to reports, Odom\u2019s wife demanded that he go to rehab in an attempt to save their marriage.<\/p>\n<p>The current status of Odom\u2019s relationship and his rehabilitation plans remain unclear. Reports from various news sources say that Lamar checked into rehab, only to check out the next day, and some sites quote him as saying that he plans on kicking his habit sans professional help. Regardless of the current status, it is clear that Lamar needs rehabilitation to mend his professional and personal life.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Lil Wayne<\/b><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_2101\" style=\"width: 366px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2101\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/lil-wayne.png\" alt=\"Lil Wayne\" width=\"356\" height=\"540\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2101\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/lil-wayne.png 356w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/lil-wayne-198x300.png 198w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/lil-wayne-300x455.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2101\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">SOURCE: lilwaynehq<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Dwayne Michael Carter, Jr., known by his stage name Lil Wayne, is another celebrity who would benefit greatly from rehab. The rap star, age 31, is one of the most famous rap artists of the last decade. In spring of this year the rapper reportedly had a seizure on the set of a music video shoot and was taken to a local hospital for treatment.<\/p>\n<p>The seizure caused many, from Wayne\u2019s close friends to news sources, to blame the artist\u2019s affinity for the drink \u201csizzurp\u201d as the cause of the incident. This drink, sometimes called Texas tea, is a mixture of cough syrup and codeine, and is known for its unique high. Even though Lil Wayne\u2019s idol, an artist known as Pimp C, died from an overdose of the drug, Wayne has still not quit.<\/p>\n<p>Lil Wayne\u2019s representatives claimed that the seizures in March were due to stress, but the fact remains that Wayne is clearly addicted to a medicine cocktail that has fatal implications. Rehabilitation and overcoming this addition are in the rapper\u2019s best interest.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Renee Alway<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Alway, a contestant on the TV competition <i>America\u2019s Next Top Model<\/i>, went from glamorous photo shoots to court. The star, a single mother, has been arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia, petty theft, and suspicion of burglary and fraud. The latter two charges were incurred in a recent incident\u2014Alway was suspiciously lurking near an abandoned house, and when authorities arrived she engaged them in a six hour standoff. Alway\u2019s sporadic behavior and lack of responsibility seems to stem for a drug problem, and the young woman\u2019s family has asked her to attend rehab on several occasions. Paranoia and crime are often associated with drug use, and it seems apparent that Alway needs rehabilitation to get back on her feet.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many celebrities are known for their over-the-top behavior and crazy antics, whether they\u2019re acting silly in an interview, wearing extremely provocative clothes, or tweeting cryptic messages.
