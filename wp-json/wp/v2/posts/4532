However, not all moodiness should be considered normal. In countries that experience different seasons in a year such as\u00a0winter, spring, autumn and summer, some people are prone to experiencing moodiness or depression\u00a0during the same season each and every year.\u00a0 This type of seasonal depression is commonly known as seasonal affective disorder.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2><strong>What is Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) ?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Seasonal Affective disorder is a type of downheartedness in which people who are known to be normal or healthy experience during the same season yearly. This is very common during the winter season. For most people, <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/depression-treatment-utah\/\">depression <\/a>kicks in during the autumn and ends in winter.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Signs of Seasonal Affective Disorder<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>It is very hard to know that one is experiencing SAD. This is because most people who experience it are usually mentally healthy throughout the year and therefore it is easy to brush it off as normal winter blues. However, there are several indicators of this type of disorder that everyone should know so that\u00a0in case\u00a0the symptoms start occurring, medical attention can be sought. Some of the symptoms include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feelings of guilt,\u00a0fear,\u00a0and despair<\/li>\n<li>Grumpiness<\/li>\n<li>Feeling sleepy most of the time and lack of enthusiasm when waking up<\/li>\n<li>Loss of interest in carrying out normal day to day activities<\/li>\n<li>Insistent low mood<\/li>\n<li>Boredom and feeling tired after doing very simple tasks<\/li>\n<li>Gaining weight and craving carbohydrates<\/li>\n<li>Loss of concentration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>How to Diagnose Seasonal Affective Disorder<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Per the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders\">American Psychiatric Association DSM-IV criteria<\/a>, Seasonal Affective Disorder is not regarded as a separate disorder. It is called a &#8220;course specifier&#8221; and may be applied as an added description to the pattern of major depressive episodes in patients with major depressive disorder or patients with bipolar disorder.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Seasonal Pattern Specifier&#8221; must meet four criteria: depressive episodes at a particular time of the year; remissions or mania\/hypomania at a characteristic time of year; these patterns must have lasted two years with no nonseasonal major depressive episodes during that same period; and these seasonal depressive episodes outnumber other depressive episodes throughout the patient&#8217;s lifetime.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What are the Causes of Seasonal Affective Disorder?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The causes of SAD are not known with certainty. However, various experts presume the following to be some of the causes.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insufficient exposure to sunlight during fall and winter can lead the brain to produce less serotonin, which is a chemical responsible for regulating mood.<\/li>\n<li>High melatonin levels. Melatonin is a hormone that controls sleeping cycles. Therefore, if the hormone is secreted in huge amounts, one may be prone to feeling sleepy all the time.<\/li>\n<li>Low levels of Vitamin D<\/li>\n<li>Triggers from things such as\u00a0use\u00a0of drugs, traumatic life occasions, body illness and changes in diet.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Most of these causes are still being studied to know exactly how they lead to this disorder.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Treating Seasonal Affective Disorder<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There are various ways of treating SAD Some of them requires one to see a doctor while others require self-treatment.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Treatments that will need one to see a physician\u00a0include:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/seasonal-affective-disorder\/in-depth\/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment\/art-20048298\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Light therapy (phototherapy)<\/strong><\/a> \u2013 This is where one sits for around thirty minutes near a light box. The light from the box is supposed to act as a supplement for sunlight during the winter seasons. This light helps in reducing melatonin and increasing serotonin.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use of antidepressants<\/strong> \u2013 It is recommended that one takes the antidepressants as winter approaches before the symptoms begin to manifest. The commonly administered antidepressant is called\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhs.uk\/conditions\/SSRIs-%28selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors%29\/Pages\/Introduction.aspx\">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/cognitive-behavioral-therapy\/\"><strong>Cognitive behavioral therapy<\/strong><\/a> \u2013 This involves attending sessions of\u00a0counseling\u00a0either as a group or with your partner for a certain period of time.
