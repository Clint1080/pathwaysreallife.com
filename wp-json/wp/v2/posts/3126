This is why it&#8217;s so important for parents to talk candidly with their children about the realities and dangers of drug use at a young age. In fact, studies have shown that parents can reduce the risk of their teenagers using drugs up to 42% by simply talking with them about drug use regularly. However, what&#8217;s a parent to do if he or she suspects a teen already has a drug problem? This can be a tricky situation, but by handling it appropriately, parents can ensure the best possible outcome.<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Make Note of Warning Signs<\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a parent or guardian who suspects that your child has a drug problem, it&#8217;s important that you gather &#8220;evidence&#8221; before confronting your teen. After all, the last thing you want is to accuse your child of something he or she isn&#8217;t guilty of. Therefore, before speaking with your child, be on the lookout for these common warning signs of a drug abuse problem:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hanging out with the &#8220;wrong&#8221; crowd<\/li>\n<li>Sudden weight loss<\/li>\n<li>Bloodshot eyes<\/li>\n<li>Lack of energy and change of sleep habits<\/li>\n<li>Unexplained drop in grades at school<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Make note of these warning signs by writing them down so that you can bring them up in the conversation you have with your child.<\/p>\n<h2>Being Calm and Assertive<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes time to actually have the conversation with your child, be sure to pick a good time for it, such as over a weekend and not before a big test or game. If you suspect that your child is under the influence, put off the conversation until you&#8217;re sure he or she is sober.<\/p>\n<p>Upon confronting a teen about drug use, don&#8217;t <em>ask<\/em> your child if he or she has been using. Instead, tell your child that you have a strong feeling or that you <em>know <\/em>it&#8217;s happening. This will make it clear up front that you won&#8217;t tolerate being lied to and that you already know what&#8217;s going on. During the initial part of the conversation, it&#8217;s important to be both calm and assertive. Let your child know that you love him or her and that you only want what&#8217;s best for his or her future. Tell your child that you also want to help him or her overcome the drug abuse problem in any way you can.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, make it clear that you will <em>not <\/em>tolerate drug use from your child. At this point, he or she may shut down on you and not want to talk about the subject any further. As a parent, however, you need to be persistent. Try to sympathize with your child and offer to seek professional help; if your child is under the age of 18, he or she may not have a choice, though you&#8217;ll be off to a better start if you can get your child to admit to the problem and actually <em>want<\/em> to seek help.<\/p>\n<p>It may take awhile for your teen to come around, but once he or she does, be sure to follow through on your promise by finding the outpatient treatment program that&#8217;s best for your child and that will allow him or her to get the help needed without having to miss school.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By the time they reach the age of 18, about half of all teenagers in the United States have abused a drug at some point in their lives.
