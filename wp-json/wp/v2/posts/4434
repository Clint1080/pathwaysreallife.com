We all worry about our height, weight, scars, or the size of our bodies in various ways. However, you should know that it&#8217;s possible to celebrate being healthy, and you can be happy and goofy on the beach while loving who you are. Though it might be tough to feel great in the summer, especially at the beginning, we want to offer some tips to help you celebrate your fabulous body. <em><strong>Here are some tips you can follow to stay positive about your body all summer long.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Fall in Love with Your Body<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There is beauty in bodies of all shapes and sizes, and you should learn to love the way you fit into your bathing suit and celebrate the diversity of bodies in the world. There are many different body types out there, not one is the same, and this something to be celebrated. Our world is made of varieties of bodies, not just one type. Your best features are what make you different. Celebrate and honor the incredibly efficient and miraculous machine that is your body. Make a list of all the amazing things it allows you to do like dancing, talking, and even making another human being. Another tip to help you feel good about yourself is to make a list of things you like about yourself that are <strong><em>unrelated to how you look<\/em><\/strong>. Are you a good singer? Did you start your own successful business? Are you compassionate to strangers? Can you cook like no one\u2019s business? Take every chance you get to read your list and celebrate you and your body.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><strong>Practice Body Positive Affirmations<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Practicing body positive affirmations is a great way to let go of our subconscious negative self-talk, and begin to learn how to embrace the beauty inside.<a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysrealliferecovery.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/positive-affirmations-to-change-your-life-ebook.pdf\"> Positive affirmations<\/a> are a part of <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/cognitive-behavioral-therapy\/\">cognitive behavioral therapy<\/a>, which helps you replace your negative feelings and thoughts with positive ones.<\/p>\n<p>Some examples of body positive affirmations you can practice may be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I love and respect my body as it is today.<\/li>\n<li>Food is not the enemy, and I thank the food I eat for nourishing my body.<\/li>\n<li>A goal weight is an arbitrary number, how I feel is what\u2019s important.<\/li>\n<li>Life doesn\u2019t start 10 pounds from now, it\u2019s already started. I can make the choice to include myself in it.<\/li>\n<li>Other people are too busy thinking about themselves to care what my weight is.<\/li>\n<li>ALL images in magazines are airbrushed, photoshopped, and distorted.<\/li>\n<li>Being skinny or fat is not my identity. I am identified by who I am on the inside, a loving, wonderful person.<\/li>\n<li>I thank you, body, for serving me in ______ way today. You always take such good care of me.<\/li>\n<li>My worth isn&#8217;t defined by my weight. I define my worth and I am worthy.<\/li>\n<li>Society has taught me to hate my ______. Today, I declare that I love my _____ because of its ______.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These subtle body affirmations seep into your subconscious mind and retrain your brain to think positively about your body, and of the most fun in the summer months.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4437\" src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Happy-overweight-teenager-smiling-with-messy-hair-at-the-beach-pier.jpg\" alt=\"Happy overweight teenager smiling with messy hair\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Happy-overweight-teenager-smiling-with-messy-hair-at-the-beach-pier.jpg 2713w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Happy-overweight-teenager-smiling-with-messy-hair-at-the-beach-pier-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Happy-overweight-teenager-smiling-with-messy-hair-at-the-beach-pier-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Happy-overweight-teenager-smiling-with-messy-hair-at-the-beach-pier-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Happy-overweight-teenager-smiling-with-messy-hair-at-the-beach-pier-360x240.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Look at Media that Makes You Feel Good<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re constantly comparing yourself to people you see online, STOP! This can be one of the most destructive things we do to ourselves. Social media is meant to entertain, inform, and connect you with old friends and distant family members. Don\u2019t use social media to make you feel bad about yourself. Follow people who celebrate the diversity of the human form, and unfollow those who make you make you feel negative. You want to surround yourself with media influences that are inclusive of all types of body types and people.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Indulge in Summer<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Make sure that you indulge in summer&#8217;s treats, but remember everything in moderation. Think about what you\u2019re eating and how it makes your body feel. Eat food that makes you feel good about your body. Eating healthy doesn\u2019t have to be bad. Try out a new cookbook or experiment in the kitchen with a balanced diet that will keep you healthy. Then, you can feel good about what you&#8217;re eating. Eat healthy, most of the time and you won\u2019t have to feel guilty about indulging occasionally.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Get Your Friends on Your Team<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Find supportive friends who love you for who you are, and don&#8217;t worry about the toxic folks out there. If you are spending time with people whom you think are not supportive, then you may need to cut them out of your life. You don&#8217;t need the negativity to bring you down. Having friends who support you and encourage you to be yourself can make a world of difference.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Wear What You Feel Good In<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Love your body, and love your wardrobe. Wear clothes that fit you and make you feel good about yourself. Also, you may want to consider getting rid of old clothes that don\u2019t fit and have been taking up space. Having an old pair of jeans that used to fit can be discouraging, so let them go and get something that makes you feel fabulous. And Keep in mind, you don&#8217;t have to wear a bikini, short shorts, or tank tops to dress summery. If clothing like that makes you uncomfortable, you don\u2019t have to wear them. You can wear a colorful maxi dress, bright lipstick, big glasses, and floppy hats are a great way to play with summer trends without making you feel uncomfortable.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4436\" src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Senior-woman-on-surf-waves-and-cliff-background-Crimea-Russia-sea.jpg\" alt=\"body-positive-senior-woman\" width=\"600\" height=\"395\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Senior-woman-on-surf-waves-and-cliff-background-Crimea-Russia-sea.jpg 2732w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Senior-woman-on-surf-waves-and-cliff-background-Crimea-Russia-sea-300x197.jpg 300w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Senior-woman-on-surf-waves-and-cliff-background-Crimea-Russia-sea-768x505.jpg 768w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Senior-woman-on-surf-waves-and-cliff-background-Crimea-Russia-sea-1024x674.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Get Moving<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Be sure that you get moving, because exercise is one of the best ways to stay healthy. It boosts your endorphins and gives you some extra serotonin. You&#8217;ll feel good about yourself, and your body will repair itself more quickly. Exercise doesn\u2019t have to be about weight loss, and it doesn\u2019t have to happen at a gym. Join a recreational sports team, go for a bike ride, or take your doggy for a walk. Try to focus on fitness goals like running a marathon or lowering your cholesterol versus weight loss. This will improve your overall health and outlook about it.<\/p>\n<p>So, now that you know\u00a0what to do, get out there and be joyful in\u00a0your fabulous body, and don&#8217;t forget to spread\u00a0the love around to others, too!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/pathwaysreallife.com-7-Tips-to-Have-a-Body-Positive-Summer.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">download pdf<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s sometimes tough to feel good about your body in the summer when all over the media and magazines feature lose weight fast articles\u00a0or fad diets to get your beach body.
