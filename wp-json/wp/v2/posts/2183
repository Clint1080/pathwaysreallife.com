But it\u2019s within our human nature to make a mistake and have a bad judgment. However, we still judge people based on what we expect of our role models. Let\u2019s be honest here, it was pretty amazing that Arnold Schwarzenegger was able to keep his affair with his housekeeper silent for over a decade, and a child came out of that. Same goes for the fact that no one seems to remember that he was videotaped doing drugs while he pumped iron, yet he was also elected as Governor! To error is human and mistakes are always made, here are some examples of that.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Rob Ford<\/h2>\n<p>Rob Ford is one name that of course comes to mind, especially lately. He has had a name for himself his whole life really. Following in his father\u2019s footsteps, Rob was elected into office in 2000 as a Councilor and in 2010 became Mayor of Toronto.\u00a0 In 2013, a video surfaced that showed him engaging in not so great acts with drug dealers in Canada. While he denied all allegations, he has since come forth and admitted his actions. While he hasn\u2019t gone to rehab (yet), he\u2019s taken the first step to admitting his problem. Hopefully, soon he will realize what his next step should be, especially to show his children what kind of role model he can be.<\/p>\n<p><center><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2184\" alt=\"Rehab Rob Ford\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/rehab-rob-ford.png\" width=\"135\" height=\"219\" \/><\/center><\/p>\n<h2>Marion Barry<\/h2>\n<p>The most shocking scandal in politics probably ever will be D.C.\u2019s \u201cMayor for Life\u201d Marion Barry. He served as Mayor of D.C. from 1975 to 1991 and again 1995 to 1999. Through both terms he was also plagued with numerous controversies through his personal life, he also had numerous professional problems. He received national interest in 1990 due to his troubles and was arrested by the FBI and served time in Federal prison which helped him be reelected in 1994. Since 2002 Marion has been continuously in the news with all kinds of bad news whether it be drug charges or other federal indictments due to tax evasion, racially charges remarks or conflict of interest charges.<\/p>\n<p><center><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2185\" alt=\"Rehab Marion Barry\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/rehab-marion-barry.png\" width=\"215\" height=\"161\" \/><\/center><\/p>\n<h2>Rush Limbaugh<\/h2>\n<p>Another shocking revelation into the underworld of drugs and politics is Rush Limbaugh. While Rush has always been an avid \u201cillegal drug use is killing this country\u201d speech type of guy, Rush did come out to say in October of 2003 that he did in fact have a drug addiction. While his arrest never came through with a conviction, he did settle his arrest out of court and was put in an 18 month drug treatment program. As of today, he has seemed to beat his demons and so much the better for it. Not all political men and woman can handle the stress and wariness that is comes with politics, Rush seem to handle this well and at the same time, able to complete and maintain his sobriety with some tact and skill. Props Rush![distance1]\n<p><center><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2186\" alt=\"Rehab Rush Limbaugh\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/rehab-rush-limbaugh.png\" width=\"165\" height=\"192\" \/><\/center><\/p>\n<h2>Steve Katz<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s always the cases that seem somewhat unreported or under reported due to what some people may consider, insignificant, which in some cases, seems very true. Case in point Steve Katz. He is a veterinarian doctor who is also currently a member of the New York State Assembly. He was arrested and agreed to a plea deal for a small charge due to possession of drugs. He has back tracked on specific issues politically due to these charges. Regardless of your beliefs, being open and honest about your demons is the first step to rehabilitation.[distance1]\n<p><center><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/rehab-steve-katz.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2187\" alt=\"Rehab Steve Katz\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/rehab-steve-katz.png\" width=\"112\" height=\"168\" \/><\/a><\/center><\/p>\n<h2>Mel LeBlanc<\/h2>\n<p>Another political figure that was reported on, but was more of gossipy story, rather than a news worthy article was <b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Mel LeBlanc<\/span><\/b> out of Arlington, TX. In 2012 was caught buying drugs after being under investigation for some time. Being turned in to the police by his wife Candy, the Councilman proceeded to admit to his issues. Mel admitted to his substance abuse problems and had previously entered rehab; he preferred to try to become sober on his own. His wife requested him to enter rehab program in 2011. In 2012, however Mel resigned from office and has somewhat stayed under the radar. Last he was somewhat heard of, was when he wrote a review of Matt Damon\u2019s movie Promised Land, as Mel is a managing partner of a drilling company.<\/p>\n<p><center><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2188\" alt=\"Rehab Mel LeBlanc\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/rehab-mel-leblanc.png\" width=\"121\" height=\"179\" \/><\/center><\/p>\n<h2>Nadia Lockyer<\/h2>\n<p>One of the most shocking scandals to date however is the scandal that started because of someone trying to better themselves by going to rehab. Bill Lockyer who is the current California State Treasurer and his\u00a0 wife Nadia Lockyer who in her own right had a name for herself as the once President of the Santa Ana School Board, found she was having a problem drinking so she went to rehab. Meeting someone in rehab, who had substance abuse problem, getting hooked on that with her schedule caused a domino effect that caused her world to shatter. While she is now in treatment, was able to save her marriage and her life is back on track and doing so much better, it took hitting rock bottom before she sought out help. This happens most often than not and its okay, it\u2019s better than never.<\/p>\n<p><center><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2189\" alt=\"Rehab Nadya Lockyer\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/rehab-nadya-lockyer.png\" width=\"294\" height=\"225\" \/><\/center><\/p>\n<h2>Other Notables<\/h2>\n<p>There have been numerous international politicians who have been a part of an investigation for their involvement in a drug ring, abusing drugs and\/or alcohol for example <b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Orlando Ranaldi<\/span><\/b> of Italy, <b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Reagan Ufomba<\/span><\/b> of Ogoni who was also linked to Nigeria, <b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Luke Flanagan<\/span><\/b> of the Irish Dail and <b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Steve Purcell<\/span><\/b> the Scottish councilor who is also known as Tony Blair\u2019s \u201cvisionary\u201d who had to be warned about an underworld plot to blackmail him due to so many acts of indiscretions.<\/p>\n<p>All of these politicians have been caught and had to <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/\">come to terms with their addictions<\/a> and have in one form or another, sought out help. Having the strength to stay sober is the next step.
