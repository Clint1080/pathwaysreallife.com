However, the cost of the addiction and what the entails is usually worse. Most services are offered\u00a0on a fee for service basis known as using a \u201csliding fee scale.\u201d The fee\u2019s themselves are based on how much you have the ability to pay. This makes sure that the ability to pay will NEVER be the reason you are not treated. While the services are never free, they are in fact extremely low cost for clients with limited means and highest of need.<\/p>\n<p>The LSAA will screen and test you using the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) to determine the correct treatment level. The ASI has seven (7) main areas that are covered due to the impact it has on a person\u2019s substance abuse and recovery. These seven areas general information about the person, history and current use of alcohol and\/or drugs, employment, education &amp; financial status, family\/social information, legal history\/status, medical information and mental and emotional well-being are what affect a person\u2019s substance abuse problem and recovery. Once this has been assessed and the correct treatment level has been discussed and decided. Then a specific program can be developed.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" size-full wp-image-2693\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/utah-addiction-counseling-300x199.png\" alt=\"utah-addiction-counseling-300x199\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;\"\/ alt=\"Therapist with patient - Outpatient Addiction Treatment in Utah\" title=\"Affordable Outpatient Alcohol Treatment Utah residence choose when sobriety is a priority\">The <a href=\"\/general-outpatient-program\/\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\" title=\"General Outpatient Treatment- Pathways Real Life Recovery -  The best-rated Outpatient Treatment Utah has to offer\">General Outpatient Treatment program<\/a> is designed for individuals\u00a0who have any number of substance abuse issues and have a stable living environment.
