Falling into old habits is all too easy in <\/span><span class=\"s2\">Salt Lake City<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> if you don&#8217;t take control of your social calendar in this way. Here is a <\/span><span class=\"s2\">list of sober activities<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> in <\/span><span class=\"s2\">Utah<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> that we hope will help you with your recovery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">1. Host a Dinner Party<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The nice thing about hosting a dinner party is that <b><i>you<\/i> <\/b>control the menu. There&#8217;s always a risk that if you show up for someone else&#8217;s dinner party, there will end up being an open bar or an extensive wine list. If you host your own party for family or friends, you can <b><i>pick out a great selection of music, prepare some new foods and provide plenty of non-alcoholic drinks for the guests<\/i><\/b>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">2. Exercise<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Working out helps you stay in tune with your body and realize your potential. Jogging, yoga, swimming, weight lifting, cardio and other activities will <b><i>help with goal-setting<\/i><\/b>, and the constant improvement from working out is a <b><i>big confidence booster<\/i><\/b>. If you purchase a gym membership, you&#8217;re likely to <b><i>make new sober friends and meet others who are into taking care of their bodies<\/i><\/b>. Golf is another great exercise that you can do alone or with a group.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">3. Get Outdoors<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are some amazing national parks and outdoor areas within just a few hours&#8217; drive of <\/span><span class=\"s2\">SLC<\/span><span class=\"s1\">. Head out of town on a Saturday morning and stay the night for a camping trip. Go for a hike! Get a fishing license and try your hand at catching and preparing your own food. <b><i>Connect with nature, get some fresh air and recharge your batteries<\/i><\/b> by getting out of the busy city for a day or two.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">4. Volunteer<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Giving back some of your time to help others is one of the most<b><i> rewarding<\/i><\/b> things you will ever do. You can volunteer at a homeless shelter, a food bank, an animal rescue shelter or any number of church ministry activities to help others in the local community. <\/span><span class=\"s2\">Sober activities<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> that involve giving back to the community will <b><i>help you stay centered and keep your mind on the &#8220;bigger picture&#8221; in life<\/i><\/b>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">5. Grow a Garden<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Nothing<b><i> teaches patience<\/i><\/b> like growing your own vegetables, herbs or flowers. You don&#8217;t need to have a spare acre in your backyard to plant a garden. Even if you live in an apartment, you can still grow smaller plants in a patio garden or on your kitchen counter, as long as your plants can get some direct sunlight during the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Get on the Road to Recovery at Pathways Recovery Center in SLC, Utah<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">These suggestions for <\/span><span class=\"s2\">sober activities<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> to help you get started down the Road to Recovery.
