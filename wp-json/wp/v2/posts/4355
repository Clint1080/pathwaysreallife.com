Many people feel\u00a0the temptation to drink during this time. If you would rather avoid drinking and maintain your sobriety, you will find lots of ways to celebrate without the need for alcohol. Cast aside the green beer just as St. Patrick cast out the snakes from Ireland. Embrace the delight that is\u00a0Irish culture without the booze.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Take an Irish Dancing Class<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Enjoy beautiful music and <em><strong>learn how to dance all kinds of age old\u00a0Irish dances right here in Utah<\/strong><\/em>.

To celebrate, the proud Irish of the\u00a0Hibernian\u00a0Society of Utah are hosting\u00a0an Irish film series just in time for St. Patrick&#8217;s Day. Join them and watch Academy-Award wining movies such as Michael Collins, Ryan&#8217;s Daughter and A Terrible Beauty. If staying home is more your style, relax with friends and family and hold an Irish movie marathon of your own. Pick out classic movies like &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Secret_of_Kells\">The Secret of\u00a0Kells<\/a>&#8221; to help bring your Irish heritage to life.<\/p>\n<h2><strong><br \/>\nThrow Your Own Party<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Invite friends over to your house and hold a St. Patrick&#8217;s Day party. Stick with people who care about helping you stay sober. Put on some Irish themed music and play party games like an Irish themed game of\u00a0Pictionary. \u00a0Expand\u00a0your knowledge of Irish culture, history and language with your friends in a low key setting for\u00a0alcohol-free fun.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Go To Utah\u2019s St. Patrick&#8217;s Day Parade<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Take some time off from your ordinary routine. Watch the parade in person on\u00a0March 12 at 10 a.m. The march begins on 400 West and\u00a0at 200 North then\u00a0runs\u00a0south through the Gateway to 200 South and\u00a0passes \u00a0through the\u00a0Gateway Center. Bask in the warming weather as the parade passes by. Parade organizers ask that all people\u00a0submit an entry form if they want to participate in the parade. \u00a0Find information about participating and walking in the parade at the\u00a0&#8220;Parade Entry&#8221; link at right. If coming from other parts of Utah, take\u00a0TRAX\u00a0to the parade and\u00a0Siamsa. This way, you can save money and\u00a0parking hassles.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Make Your Own Irish Feast<\/strong><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_4356\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4356\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4356 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015-02-19_Hardin-slow-cooker-corned-beef-main-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Slow Cooker Corned Beef &amp; Cabbage Sliders with Guinness Mustard\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015-02-19_Hardin-slow-cooker-corned-beef-main-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015-02-19_Hardin-slow-cooker-corned-beef-main-360x240.jpg 360w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015-02-19_Hardin-slow-cooker-corned-beef-main.jpg 590w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-4356\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Recipe by Becky Hardin via Celebrations.com<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Irish cooking is a lively combination of ingredients like potatoes, fish, cabbage and smoked beef\u00a0that everyone loves.
