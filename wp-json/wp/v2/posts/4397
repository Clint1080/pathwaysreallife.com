But if your family is struggling with <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/drug-rehab-sandy-utah\/\">drug addiction<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/alcohol-treatment\/\">alcohol addiction<\/a>, one of the best gifts you can give is the dedication to staying sober. Whether your mother is your inspiration for remaining sober, or you are a mother (or father) wanting to stay sober for your children, there are many reasons on this Mother&#8217;s Day to choose sobriety. <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/\">Pathways Real Life Recovery is here to help<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Find your Inner Peace<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes it can seem as if the cycle of addiction is a never-ending spiral of <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/depression-treatment-utah\/\">depression<\/a>, guilt, and the stigma associated with addiction can leave you feeling ashamed. The natural instinct at these times may be to isolate yourself, especially from your loved ones. However, it is the connections we share with our loved ones that are the best motivators for remaining sober. <strong><em>Guilt and loneliness are the top reasons for relapse, but love and communication support healing.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><u>This Mother&#8217;s Day, consider celebrating by:<\/u><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Thanking a supportive figure in your life. This could be your mother, a supportive friend, or another relative.<\/li>\n<li>Do a random act of kindness for another.<\/li>\n<li>Be kind to yourself, healing takes grace and time.<\/li>\n<li>If need be, contact someone to help. Pathways Real Life Recovery can assist with your healing process by silencing the shame, developing self-worth, and highlighting supportive relationships and accountability.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Learn to Love<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>One of the most destructive lies our addictions tell us is that we are not worthy of love. This can not only make it difficult to love and respect ourselves, but to participate in loving relationships with others. One of the keys to remaining sober is rejecting this lie for what it is, and realizing that we each are valuable and deserving of love. This Mother&#8217;s Day, accept the love which is given to you in the spirit in which it was given, and try not to second guess why you are worthy of it. If this proves to be too difficult, do not be ashamed of reaching out for help. <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/adult-teen-adolescent-behavioral-health-clinic-utah\/\">Pathways Real Life Recovery helps you to work on your relationship with yourself<\/a>, so instead of being belittled by your past, <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/changing-core-beliefs-emotional-reactions-behaviors\/\">you can revise your belief system<\/a> and love yourself again.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>You Deserve a Second Chance<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>For many, entering a <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/recovery-program\/\">recovery program<\/a> is a last ditch effort, but you do not need to be at death&#8217;s door to seek help. If addiction is impacting your life, injuring your relationships, or making it hard to maintain a job recovery should be one of the first steps you take, not the last.

Making the commitment to remain clean and sober today is the first step.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/parent-child-therapy\/\">mother (or father) struggling with addiction, please know that your relationship with your children is one of the most precious gifts in life<\/a>.
