Some of these factors include physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, or loss of loved ones to death or removal from the environment. Physical and emotional trauma \u2013 domestic violence, instability, substance abuse \u2013 can also be huge elements in the development of aggressive or counterproductive behaviors.<\/p>\n<p>There are internal factors singular to the individual, from mental illness or personality disorder to a learning disorder, physical trauma or physical disability, which can cause a gamut of stress and insecurity in a <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/benefits-parent-child-interaction-therapy\">developing child\u2019s brain and behaviors<\/a>. Children and teens may opt to keep their disability or disorder a secret, for fear of ridicule or being ostracized. Their externalized behaviors can then lead to expulsion from school \u2013 which is much more preferable than isolation from peers. Results can escalate to\u00a0arrest or detainment by authorities, and carry greater risk of criminal patters and incarceration.<\/p>\n<h2>Treatment for Children, Teens and Adults in Utah<\/h2>\n<p>When presented with the need for treatment, the externalizer will also often rationalize the many reasons why they <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/changing-core-beliefs-emotional-reactions-behaviors\/\">engage in these patterns and why they need those behaviors to cope<\/a> \u2013 to insulate themselves against pain, sadness, intimidation or feelings of inadequacy, or to avoid confronting the root issue.\u00a0 Sometimes the reasoning can be as simple for them as \u201cI feel better when I drink, because it makes me feel happy\u201d.\u00a0 These rationales need to be identified head on, and the positive possibilities of treatment presented with equal clarity.\u00a0Counseling, therapy, and sometimes medication are all options that can be discussed and reviewed, but it\u2019s important that not only the individual receive help and intervention \u2013 it\u2019s equally important for him or her to realize that a full, functional, and productive life is possible with the right tools, knowledge, and therapy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>For a free consultation and more information, please <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/\">contact us<\/a> at 801-895-3006.
