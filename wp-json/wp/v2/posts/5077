But for many people, this time can bring or worsen anxiety, depression, and stress. This can be caused by many factors which may include increased financial burden as a result of travel, gifts and hotel charges. You may also be overwhelmed since the holiday season includes lots of parties, traveling, and performances which are difficult to balance with everyday self-care and responsibilities. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Pathways Real Life Recovery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> offers mental health counseling services in Sandy, Utah. <\/span><b><i>If you experience one of the above challenges, the following are tips that you can use to manage your increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression during your holiday<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>1. Improve Your Physical Health<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can introduce some form of regular exercise during the holiday. <\/span><b><i>Exercise strengthens the lungs and heart and also releases dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and endorphins that have an energizing effect and lift our mood<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. The effects of exercise are felt instantly, unlike medication which can take several weeks to kick in. Exercise also contributes to a more positive body image, which can be helpful for those wishing to increase their self-esteem and self-confidence.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>2. Build Your Resilience<\/strong><br \/>\n<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You should build your emotional resilience to cope with ups and downs during a holiday. <\/span><b><i>Resilience is our ability to maintain or recover good feeling about ourselves, independent of the environment we may find ourselves in<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Emotional resilience can be achieved in many ways, but the most crucial is by:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Talking to someone,<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> e.g., to a friend, family member or a counselor, because communication releases tension that may build up inside.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Improving your self-esteem &#8211;<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> this is particularly important since many situations in our lives, such as relationship break-ups, not getting the job we want, can dramatically lower our self-esteem. People wishing to improve their self-esteem must treat themselves in a positive but honest way.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Managing your stress levels &#8211;<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> reduce your working hours, ask for help, get some regular &#8216;me-time&#8217; when you can completely relax and unwind by developing good relationships with your friends, family or your partner.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>3. Take Care of Yourself<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Paying attention to your own feeling and needs is essential. <\/span><b><i>You must try to achieve a balance between what you enjoy and your daily responsibilities, in order to prevent a build-up of stress and negative emotions<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Consider learning and discovering new things. Research has proved that by simply walking a small distance when on holiday can reduce stress and blood pressure naturally. Finally, <\/span><b><i>avoid drugs and alcohol to cope<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Even though escaping may sound appealing, drugs and alcohol actually worsen symptoms. <\/span><b><i>Choosing a well-balanced diet and drinking water over alcohol is guaranteed that you will feel much better, both physically and emotionally<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Pathways Real Life Recovery Center is Here to Help <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If stress becomes too much to handle, people can develop <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/anxiety-treatment-utah\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">anxiety<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and\/or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/depression-treatment-utah\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">depression<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and even turn to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/drug-rehab-sandy-utah\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">drugs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/alcohol-treatment\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">alcohol<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to try and cope. <em><strong>Mental illness is difficult to deal with, but it can be even harder during the holidays.
