Some students take fervent notes in class and some prefer to watch the lecturer and listen. Regardless of the undertaking, there is almost always more than one way to accomplish it. The same is true of substance abuse therapy where there are dozens of types of unique rehabilitation programs. If you or someone you know is suffering from a substance abuse problem, finding a program that caters to their needs and wants is of the upmost importance. After all, who would want to be forced to shower in the morning when they are a shower at night kind of person? Finding the rehabilitation program that suits the addict most is more likely to foster success in overcoming the problem.<br \/>&nbsp;<\/br><\/p>\n<p>Here is a quick overview of some of the main kinds of <a href=\"\/programs\/\" title=\"Substance Abuse Rehabilitation - Get help with Addiction Recovery in Utah at Pathways Real Life Recovery\" >substance abuse rehabilitation<\/a> at  <a href=\"\/\" title=\"Top-Rated substance rehabilitation in Utah - Behavioral Treatment Center for Addiction Recovery and Substance Abuse Treatment\" >Pathways Real Life Recovery<\/a> in Utah.<\/br><\/br><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Types of Rehabilitation Programs<\/h2>\n<p><b><\/p>\n<h3>Medicine Based Drug Rehabilitation Programs: <\/h3>\n<p><\/b><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1953\" alt=\"Helping Hand - Types of Substance Abuse Rehabilitation\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/Addiction-Rehab-Services-PathwaysRealLife-Utah-1.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"212\" title=\"Types of Substance Abuse Rehabilitation - Top-rated Substance Rehabilitation and Addiction Recovery in Utah\"  \/>Just as the name suggests, these kind of programs focus on the medical facets of addiction including physiological dependence and withdrawal. Most substances that cause addiction have been studied extensively by doctors and pharmaceutical companies, resulting in sound clinical methods to help decrease addiction and withdrawal. Some medications are even Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, indicating that they have undergone extensive clinical trials and have been proven effective throughout. Although medications are the main tool, most medicine based substance abuse rehabilitation programs also include some counseling, most often advising the addict to lead a life of abstinence to avoid drug addiction in the future. Because of the sound research concerning various drugs, medical-based rehabilitation programs can be incredibly successful, especially at lessening the effects of withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p><b><\/p>\n<h3>Spiritual Drug Rehabilitation Programs:<\/h3>\n<p><\/b><\/p>\n<p>Spiritual drug rehabilitation programs bring religion and spirituality into the recovery process. Many proponents of this type of program believe that addiction can be cured by faith in God. In order to overcome addiction, one needs to have faith in God and in His care. In these kinds of programs, those receiving treatment are admonished to give up themselves to God and trust that He will take care of them and their addiction. One of the thoughts behind this is that if faith in God and thinking about God totally encompasses a person\u2019s mind processes every day, addiction will be pushed out and a new positive outlook and faith will be able to take root. There are different types of spiritual drug rehabilitation programs based on different religious beliefs, but all focus on spirituality and a belief in God as ways to overcome addiction.<\/p>\n<p><b><\/p>\n<h3>Holistic Drug Rehabilitation Programs:<\/h3>\n<p><\/b><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1954\" alt=\"Self Healing - Rehabilitation Substance Abuse Utah\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/utah-rehabilitation.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"198\" title=\"Types of Substance Abuse Rehabilitation - Residential Substance Rehabilitation and Addiction Recovery in South-Central Utah\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/utah-rehabilitation.png 453w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/utah-rehabilitation-300x199.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/> Instead of focusing on the medical aspects of addiction or the spiritual aspects in their entirety, a holistic rehab center focuses on the over-all recovery of the patient and all of the aspects of that recovery. Attention is paid to the individual\u2019s psychological state and any issues that they might have that have led to addiction. Extensive counseling and examination of the development of the individual are common. Holistic approaches to drug abuse also use exercises like yoga, dietary supplements, and an emphasis on good nutrition. By focusing on the many aspects of addiction and a healthy life, these programs often have very high success rates and may foster lifelong habits of healthful activities.<\/p>\n<p>While the three main types of <a href=\"\/programs\/\" title=\"Top-rated substance abuse rehabilitation in Utah - rehabilitation substance abuse\">substance rehabilitation<\/a> have been highlighted here, further research will show countless others.
