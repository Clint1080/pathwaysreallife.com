In fact, struggling with negative beliefs about yourself makes it all too easy to lapse into self-destructive patterns. That\u2019s why breaking that no-win cycle of low self-esteem &#8212; and the bad choices related to it &#8212; is the first step to a more peaceful, productive life. Here are a few methods to help you get there.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Consider the Source\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>A loving family does not inflict harsh judgment on young children, nor do truly responsible teachers and coaches insult impressionable young people. If you were told you were lazy, unintelligent or homely as a child, remind yourself that those characterizations reflect badly on the adult who said them, rather than on you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Assignment<\/strong>: Write a letter to a person from your past who damaged your self-esteem. You don\u2019t have to actually send the letter but focus on describing that person\u2019s unrealistic standards or constant judgment. The act of writing the letter will help you understand how those unfair words shaped you.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Remember That \u201cComparisons are Odious\u201d<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s a centuries-old saying, but one that still resonates today. Comparing your life or personality to the success of a friend or colleague is one of the surest ways to spiral into self-loathing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Assignment:<\/strong>\u00a0Each day, make a note of something positive about yourself. Whether it\u2019s a kindness you did for a co-worker, a new skill you\u2019ve mastered, or even something \u201cvain\u201d like a flattering new hairstyle, it\u2019s important to make note of these good things. Periodically reading this self-positivity journal will help you understand your own self-worth.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Name Your Unhealthy Beliefs<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s one thing to know in general that a bad self-image will bring you down &#8212; and another to identify some specific faults. Once you identify those supposed flaws, you can start to learn how to break that cycle of self-doubt.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Assignment<\/strong>:\u00a0<a title=\"Changing Core Beliefs, Emotional Reactions and Behaviors - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/changing-core-beliefs-emotional-reactions-behaviors\/\">Belief-restructuring therapy\u00a0<\/a>can be an essential tool on your road to well-being. Customized treatment sessions help you identify, then address, these core beliefs about yourself that are weighing you down emotionally.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Interrogate Your Fears<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>It seems logical that if we have something we dislike about ourselves, then we\u2019d do anything to change it, right? Yet lurking within many of us is the suspicion that what we don\u2019t like is so intrinsic to our personalities that it can\u2019t be changed &#8212; or that even if we solve or disprove that one trait, even worse ones will be lurking. Therefore, it\u2019s easier to complain about what we don\u2019t like about ourselves, rather than to do something which might fail.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Assignment<\/strong>: It may seem silly, but the question \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d is an essential one to ask. Often, naming your fear makes you realize that it\u2019s either unlikely or easily solved. And if you find that this simple, self-directed exercise isn\u2019t doing the trick, there are other options.\u00a0<a title=\"Anxiety Treatment in Utah - Changing Negative Beliefs - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/anxiety-treatment-utah\/\">Professional sessions specially designed to treat anxiety<\/a>\u00a0are excellent tools in your quest to banish those negative beliefs and their surrounding fears.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Envision a Brighter Future<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Once you do begin to overcome your fear of failure and explode some of those self-doubting myths, it\u2019s time to expand your horizons. If you\u2019ve always told yourself you weren\u2019t creative, for example, what can you now accomplish, after accepting that you might have an artistic bent after all?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Assignment<\/strong>: Now comes the fun part. Brainstorm ways to catch up on what you\u2019ve been missing all those years when you decreed yourself not good enough for a certain pursuit, be it hobby, career or even romance! Make a list of all you\u2019ve been missing and concrete steps you can take to achieve the goals you once believed you weren\u2019t good enough for.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>A Way Forward<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Ready to stop the self-destructive cycle?\u00a0<a title=\"Request More Information - Changing Negative Beliefs - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/contact\/\">We&#8217;re always here<\/a>\u00a0to help you learn\u00a0more about our testing, therapy and treatment services.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><a title=\"Download PDF - Changing Negative Beliefs- Pathways Real Life Recovery\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/pathwaysreallife.com-5-Ways-to-Change-Negative-Beliefs.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download PDF<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sometimes the enemy within can be much more dangerous than outside forces.
