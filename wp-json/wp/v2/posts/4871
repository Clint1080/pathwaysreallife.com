In some instances, these thoughts may are fueled by external factors such as societal discrimination or internal factors such as self-pity. <strong><em>In the long run, negative thoughts puncture our esteem and happiness<\/em><\/strong>. The good news is that it <strong><em>is<\/em><\/strong> possible to be happy during addiction. Here are some five ways we can achieve this endeavor;<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>1. Focus on Your Strengths and Never Your Weaknesses<\/h3>\n<p>Despite the addiction glitch, <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/inspirational-addiction-recovery-quotes\/\">our strengths are deeply embedded in us<\/a> and can be unleashed at will. To start with, conduct a \u201cmoral inventory\u201d of yourself to determine your strengths. These strengths could be <strong><em>your capacity to love more, sense of humor, and creativity.<\/em><\/strong> As often as possible, practice these strengths in your daily routine and make them the foundation of your recovery.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Surround Yourself with Positivity<\/h3>\n<p>For you to achieve happiness, you have to change what you do, your thoughts, what you associated with and your old company. It is never easy to change these aspects of your life, and it calls for consistency and commitment. For starters, you can join a support group to help you foster positive thoughts. The bottom line is <strong><em>creating a new circle of friends, friends who believe in you and the results you want to achieve<\/em><\/strong>. It is normal to feel sad sometimes amidst these, but with consistency, it is possible to turn over a new leaf.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Find a New Hobby<\/h3>\n<p>Replacing addiction with a new <strong><em>positive habit or hobby helps to keep us occupied and away from the drugs<\/em><\/strong>. However, it also starts with the mind, by believing that it <strong><em>is<\/em><\/strong> possible to have fun devoid of drugs. You can start by adopting simple habits such as taking an evening or morning walk. Later, you can enroll in a sports club, or volunteering to keep your mind occupied.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Be Mindful of the Moment<\/h3>\n<p>Focusing on how you feel <strong><em>at a particular moment <\/em><\/strong>rather than how you feel generally can help you achieve some self-awareness. <strong><em>Self-awareness enables you to control your feelings and emotions<\/em><\/strong>. You can start by pausing every few hours and taking a few deep breaths and focusing on how your body feels at that moment. Do not shy away from the pain, rather try to address its cause and find someone who you can talk to. By taking on life in moments, we can channel positive energy in our deeds and thoughts hence achieving happiness.<\/p>\n<h2>Addiction Treatment Center in Utah You Can Count On at Pathways Real Life Recovery<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/\"><strong><em>Pathways Life Recovery<\/em><\/strong><\/a><strong><em> in Utah seeks to help people with addictions of all kinds to achieve a more positive life.<\/em><\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/our-services\/\">Our services<\/a> are centered therapy and breaking the cycle of guilt associated with addiction.
