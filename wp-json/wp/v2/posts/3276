Many addicts believe that if they have made a commitment to quit drugs and alcohol, they should be able to indulge themselves in their diet. However, even on the road to recovery, you should be mindful of your daily eating habits as they can enhance your chances of long-term success. How? Proper diet and nutrients can resupply your body with what it needs to function optimally. Nutrition can improve various body tissues and organs to serve their primary purposes in keeping your body healthy. Plus, a balanced diet has been shown to improve mood and general health. As you eat better, you are more likely to feel better, too. As a result of your enhanced mood, you are more likely to remain in recovery and avoid relapse. A total diet revolution may be too much for someone who was once eating pizza, chips, and beer every day. Instead of making too many drastic changes, try to implement small changes to your diet over a span of weeks.<\/p>\n<h2>\u00a0<b>Recovery Diet Plan: Small Changes for a Healthier Future<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Remember to take baby steps in your diet if you have never been accustomed to eating healthy. These changes can be difficult to make. If you attempt too much at once, you could end up giving up on all your healthy behaviors and retreating back to substances.<\/p>\n<h3>\u00a0Follow these tips to build a healthy eating plan during recovery:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Begin taking a multivitamin to supply your body with the vitamins and nutrients it has been lacking.<\/li>\n<li>Eat three regular, balanced meals per day that are low in fat, high in protein, and consisting of complex carbohydrates and fiber.<\/li>\n<li>Good sources of protein include lean chicken, turkey, lean cuts of red meat, different varieties of fish such as salmon and tuna for omega-3\u2019s, eggs, and nuts<\/li>\n<li>Complex carbohydrates include whole grains such as brown rice, wheat bread, oats as well as fruits and veggies like broccoli, spinach, berries, and apples<\/li>\n<li>Prevent dehydration by drinking water frequently throughout the day. If you do not prefer plain water, add lemon. Green tea is also a terrific beverage that provides numerous health benefits.<\/li>\n<li>If you have cravings, that is a sign that you should eat. Pack healthy snacks to enjoy throughout the day such as almonds or dried fruit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Foods to Avoid During\u00a0Substance Abuse Recovery<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-3278\" style=\"margin: 10px;\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/160576234.jpg\" alt=\"Foods to Avoid During Substance Abuse Recovery\" title=\"Balanced nutrition can help with addiction recovery - Pathways Real Life Recovery\" width=\"418\" height=\"302\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/160576234.jpg 697w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/160576234-300x217.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" \/><\/h3>\n<p>Many of those in addiction recovery turn from one culprit to another during recovery by getting addicted to sugar. Eating foods high in sugar provide a rush of energy and a spike in blood sugar. However, blood sugar quickly crashes leaving you craving more sugar. Avoid excessive sugar including foods loaded with refined and processed carbohydrates such as white breads, sodas, and pasta. In addition, minimize your caffeine consumption as it can be addictive as well. If you must drink coffee or tea, try drinking decaf or only enjoy one caffeinated serving per day.
