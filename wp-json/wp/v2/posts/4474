If you have a family member or friend that has Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), and you\u2019ve decided to help them, here are some tips that can help.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Learn About Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The best thing you can do is<em><strong> arm yourself with information about Borderline Personality Disorder.<\/strong><\/em> Instead of getting into a yelling match, you can find solutions by learning how to speak to them. Understanding the symptoms and how to respond to\u00a0those with Borderline Personality Disorder\u00a0can make the experience of engagement a productive one.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Rules for Engagement<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to dealing with a person with Borderline Personality Disorder it is important to learn how to engage. The most important things to remember are- you didn\u2019t cause this person to behave this way, you can\u2019t cure this disease, and you most certainly can\u2019t control the outbursts. During this type of engagement, it is <em><strong>best to simplify your statements<\/strong><\/em>. Remember emotion is likely to be so strong, so <em><strong>make each sentence short, simple, and direct. Leave no room for misinterpretation<\/strong><\/em>. By remembering these things, you can keep a level head.<\/p>\n<p>You can also practice a method called Delay, Distract, Depersonalize, and Detach.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Delay<\/strong>: Delay engaging in an outburst with a Borderline Personality Disorder, with a calm voice, and by telling them to give you more time to think about what they are saying.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Distract:<\/strong> Try suggesting the two of you do something else like run errands or go out.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Depersonalize:<\/strong> What they are saying is not real and you should not allow yourself to feel the sting of their words. It\u2019s just another outburst.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Detach:<\/strong> Refuse to allow yourself to caught up in an emotional response to their words during an outburst.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><strong>Support Yourself<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When a situation becomes too hectic or chaotic and you are finding it difficult to disengage, it is best to leave in order to take care of yourself and deal with your own feelings. Seek counseling for yourself if necessary, or join a support group. There are therapists in your area that deal specifically with Borderline Personality Disorder and their family members or can point you in the direction of a group therapy session.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Never Ignore Comments about Suicide<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If someone with Borderline Personality Disorder is threatening to take their own life, harm themselves or bring harm to someone else, immediately call your local <a href=\"http:\/\/www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org\/gethelp\/lifelinechat.aspx\">suicide support line<\/a> at 1-800-273-TALK (8255)\u00a0or 911. Under no circumstances should you leave this person alone.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Seek Treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) from a Licensed Therapist in Utah<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you feel that the situation has exhausted you and other family members, you should seek professional help from a licensed therapist that specifically specializes in treating Borderline Personality Disorder patients. <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/borderline-personality-disorder-treatment\/\">Pathways Real Life Recovery offers Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) treatment in Utah<\/a>.
