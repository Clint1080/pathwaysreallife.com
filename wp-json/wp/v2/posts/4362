Avoid getting stressed out about the job search since these stresses will likely tempt you to go back down the dark path you worked so hard to overcome.<\/p>\n<p>To keep stress down, compartmentalize your life into manageable areas while surrounding yourself with a network of support. Whether that is family, sober friends or a mentor at rehab, stay close to the people who will keep you on the right footing.<\/p>\n<p>Rely on your support group, but do not rely on them exclusively: There are also factors solely within your control.<\/p>\n<p>First, stay positive.

Not only is this untrue, but this line of thinking makes it easy to sell yourself short.<\/p>\n<p>You have so much to offer the world, so persevere, stay positive and you will be amazed at how far your hard work and resilience will take you.<\/p>\n<h2>Sticking With Your Rehab Program During the Job Search<\/h2>\n<p>One of the best things you can do during a job search is to focus on the things you can control.
