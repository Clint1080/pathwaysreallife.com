You may simply avoid going out because you don\u2019t want to start the conversation to make plans.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Worrying your small group of friends is getting tired of you<\/strong> \u2013 You probably have a small group of friends you hang out with in the summer, but you may worry that they are getting tired of you, which may lead you to cancel plans.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Making plans, then cancelling at the last minute<\/strong> \u2013 Sometimes plans to go out sound great, until the day it\u2019s time to head out. You may find yourself bailing at the last minute because you don\u2019t feel like you have the energy to deal with people.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Never getting a tan because you stay indoors all summer<\/strong> \u2013 Instead of heading out for a healthy dose of vitamin D, you may find that you constantly stay indoors throughout the summer.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><strong>Overcoming Your Struggles<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Being an introvert isn\u2019t a bad thing, but if you find that it\u2019s leaving you struggling this summer, <strong><em>you can find ways to overcome those struggles.<\/em><\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pathways Real Life Recovery<\/a> offers excellent services that can help you learn to branch out more as an introvert.
