Over the generations, fostering the self-discipline of mindfulness has made its way into various Western therapies, due to its demonstrated physical and <a title=\"Practicing Mindfulness for Overcoming Obstacles to Substance Abuse Treatment\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/overcoming-obstacles-to-substance-abuse-treatment\/\">mental health benefits<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"What-is\">What is Mindfulness?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mindfulness is the simple yet challenging mental practice of <em>being aware<\/em> of your own thoughts in the moment and of your experiences of your world and your engagements with it \u2014 without judging them. It\u2019s about <em>responding<\/em> instead of <em>reacting<\/em> to the occurrences that present themselves to you through the moments and days of your life. It involves a developed skill in tracking one\u2019s mental activities, emotional feelings, and physical sensations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Some important benefits of exercising mindfulness are:<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<html>\n<head>\n<style>\ntable {\n  font-family: arial, sans-serif;\n  border-collapse: collapse;\n  width: 100%;\n}\n\ntd, th {\n  border: 1px solid #f27d35a6;\n  text-align: left;\n  padding: 8px;\n}\n\ntr:nth-child(even) {\n  background-color: #f27d35a6;\n}\n<\/style>\n<\/head><figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Relief from <a title=\"Anxiety Treatment &#038; Practicing Mindfulness to Stay Calm\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/anxiety-treatment-utah\/\">anxiety<\/a><\/td><td>Reduced blood pressure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Lower stress level<\/td><td>Better cardiovascular health<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Reduced <a title=\"Best Depression Treatment in Utah- Mindfulness Can Help Depression\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/depression-treatment-utah\/\">depression<\/a><\/td><td>Decreased chronic pain<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Better quality of sleep<\/td><td>Improved mood <a title=\"Mood Disorder Treatment Center in Utah\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/mood-disorder-treatment-in-utah\/\">balance<\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Elevated work performance<\/td><td>Greater sense of inner peace<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"Misconceptions-of\">Misconceptions of Mindfulness<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The point of practicing mindfulness is not to reach a <em>blank<\/em> mental state. On the contrary, it is about being <em>more <\/em>aware, more fully <em>present<\/em>. It is about sharpening one\u2019s awareness of moments and thoughts and emotions and sensations. The point is to embrace awareness, not <em>expel<\/em> awareness from the mind. It is an exercise in curiosity about <em>all<\/em> that passes through the consciousness, and in freeing the mind from judgement about any of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although <em>mindfulness<\/em> is a part of various forms of <em>meditation<\/em>, the two are not the <em>same<\/em> thing. Meditation is a dedicated activity, planned and executed, whereas mindfulness is best understood as a developed <em>way of thinking about your thoughts and experiences as they are occurring<\/em>. It\u2019s a practice of observing and accepting one\u2019s own perceptions of reality in everyday life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"Why-Is-Mindfulness-Hard-to\">Why Is Mindfulness Hard to Achieve?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s social and professional atmosphere can seem like immersion in a state of rapid and constant change. The persistent high energy and sense of perpetual rushing can cause a sense of disequilibrium, often leading to anxiety and even consequences of mental and emotional overload. The relentless daily exposure to it all can be a lot to manage <em>and<\/em> keep a sense of balance, peace, and contentment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-therapeutic focus on building a richer and more objective awareness of one\u2019s self and world (mindfulness), along with cultivating a mindset of <a title=\"The Neuroscience of Gratitude and How It Affects Anxiety and Grief\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/the-neuroscience-of-gratitude-and-how-it-affects-anxiety-and-grief\/\">gratitude<\/a> involves adopting <a title=\"Rewiring Your Brain to be Happier- Practicing Mindfulness\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/rewiring-your-brain-to-be-happier\/\">new ways of thinking<\/a>. Observing our thoughts and ways of processing our experiences require slowing down enough to experience the present more fully.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That can feel awkward for people who have recently come to practicing mindfulness. Like any other skill, it takes <em>practice<\/em> to master it, and every individual must try some techniques to discover which ones are most effective for him\/her. Fortunately, it\u2019s fun to do, so it\u2019s soothing just to keep <em>trying<\/em> to exercise our own techniques for mindful self-observation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even better, there\u2019s no possibility of failure while you\u2019re <em>trying<\/em> to be mindful. In efforts at mindfulness, trying <em>is<\/em> succeeding. In other words, to <em>try<\/em> to focus on being mindful is what it is to <em>be<\/em> mindful in that moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"Mindfulness-for-Help-in-Trauma\">Mindfulness for Help in Trauma Recovery<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving through life at high speed is a manner of coping for many people struggling with the <a title=\"Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment in Utah\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd-treatment-in-utah\/\">effects of past trauma<\/a>. Practicing mindfulness offers an important tool for helping overcome the often long-lasting effects of trauma. Each person can choose a level of practice to imbue daily consciousness with greater mindfulness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In making the effort toward more mindful living, each person can be anticipated to find and enjoy his\/her <em>own<\/em> level and comfortable pace of the practice. It can be as easy as closing your eyes and or just sitting quietly and intentionally <em>listening to your own thoughts and feelings<\/em>, without judging them as they flow through you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being mindful is being fully <em>present<\/em> in your environment, being fully <em>aware<\/em> of your mental, emotional, and physical responses to it, and discovering that you are feeling comfortable with yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"Mindfulness-for-Help-in-Relapse\">Mindfulness for Help in Relapse Prevention<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Practicing powerful techniques for developing a habit of mindfulness can help people suffering from substance abuse disorder, anxiety, <a title=\"Treat Severe Depression- Mindfulness is One of The Key\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/its-time-to-change-the-way-we-view-and-treat-severe-depression\/\">depression<\/a>, and other <a title=\"Mental Health Services We Provide at Pathways\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/mental-health-services\/\">mental health issues<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One vast value of mindfulness is its effectiveness in a person\u2019s efforts toward training his or her own mind to navigate through challenging thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations without reacting to them by practicing unhealthy or even self-destructive behaviors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An extraordinarily beneficial effect of training one\u2019s own mind to sustain a state of increased mindfulness is a greater ability to detect initial <a title=\"Mindfulness-Based Drug &amp; Alcohol Relapse Prevention (MBRP)\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/relapse-prevention-utah\/\">signs of relapse<\/a> risk by observing your own thoughts, emotions, and physical experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Practicing<\/em> <em>awareness<\/em> of what you are experiencing in these ways can empower you to recognize and respond to early signs of oncoming internal derailing that has led to substance abuse in the past. <em>Using<\/em> your mindfulness this way can be very powerful in helping sustain addiction recovery. It also enables us to show <em>self-compassion<\/em> even if relapse occurs. It further helps a person more adeptly bring himself or herself back out of substance abuse <em>sooner<\/em>, and with even better-developed tools for more lasting success in sobriety going forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"How-Can-I-Practice\">How Can I Practice Mindfulness?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Practicing mindfulness is a very simple matter of quieting the mind and paying attention to your thoughts as they flow into and out of your mind. It\u2019s just observing your thoughts as they come and go. This is what it is to just <em>be present<\/em>, also known as to <em>live in the moment<\/em>. It\u2019s a way to inner balance and greater happiness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, being <em>simple<\/em> doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s <em>easy<\/em>. It does take practice to eventually find oneself more automatically maintaining an ongoing state of mindfulness. So, practice for a few minutes each day, until you find it becoming a more frequent habit. Strengthen your newly developing habit by continuing to practice it <em>intentionally<\/em> during times when you find you have drifted out of the mindset.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Continue this process until you find yourself eventually living more continuously in a mindful state. But, mindfulness is naturally an <em>endeavor<\/em> \u2014 with progress for those who continue the practice \u2014 not a permanent accomplishment. Take comfort in that fact as you embark on an ever-aspiring life-long journey of gently coaxing your mind into greater extents of mindful awareness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"External-Aids-for-Cultivating\">External Aids for Cultivating Mindfulness<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Practicing mindfulness can be challenging in our busy lives and fast-paced environment, but we have the benefit of a great wealth of <a title=\"Contact Our Experts to Know the Benefits of Mindfulness\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/\">resources for cultivating mindfulness<\/a>. If it helps, you might try attending organized mindfulness group sessions. There are also abundant group meditation opportunities. Or, just walk, sit, lie down, bike, or do something else that helps you free your consciousness to use the activity for focusing your awareness on all the thoughts and sensations you experience while engaged in it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern technologies offer additional resources for developing mindfulness. For example, you can watch online instructional videos and podcasts offering mindfulness guidance. There are even free apps to aid in meditation, and others for developing and practicing mindfulness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"Pathways-Real-Life-Recovery\">Pathways Real Life Recovery, Sandy Utah<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We are a mental health and addiction recovery treatment center providing <a title=\"Top Inpatient Drug Rehab &amp; Addiction Center\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/what-is-inpatient-rehab-for-addiction-like\/\">inpatient drug rehab<\/a>, <a title=\"List of Programs That Will Help You Fight Addiction\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/programs\/\">inpatient alcohol rehab<\/a>, and <a title=\"Best Outpatient Treatment Center for Addiction &amp; Mental Health Treatment\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/outpatient-recovery\/\">outpatient treatment<\/a> in Utah.
