Even untreated or incompletely treated mental conditions like anxiety or depression can be the cause behind intake of drugs or alcohol. These problems may appear to be less severe and may induce momentary relief. This encourages dependence.<\/li>\n<li>Substance abuse worsens any apparent or underlying mental conditions. Cute intoxication and withdrawal take a toll on both mental and physical health. Inducing the will to keep oneself away from drugs can take a lot of strength and courage out of a person, which leads to lack of focus, confused state of mind and delirium.<\/li>\n<li>Continued and excessive substance abuse can be the cause behind mental health problems. Someone who has depended on drugs or alcohol to maintain his or her calm for years on end might not be able to survive without it, thus inducing sever hallucinations, and tendency to indulge in criminal activities.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1962\" style=\"width: 222px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1962\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1962\" src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/salt-lake-city-rehab3.png\" alt=\"Salt Lake City Rehab\" width=\"212\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/salt-lake-city-rehab3.png 515w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/salt-lake-city-rehab3-213x300.png 213w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/salt-lake-city-rehab3-300x423.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1962\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><center>SOURCE: <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/mental-illness-info.jpg\">psychcentral<\/a><\/center><\/p><\/div>\n<p>Substance abuse can often drive a person to use desperate measures to retain some balance in their lives, which they only see in the form of suicide. Drug abuse often leads to an increased feeling of unfulfillment which patients resolve through increased torture on themselves which ends in tragic death or suicide.<\/p>\n<p>Often similar factors lead to problems of substance abuse and mental imbalances like genetic disturbances or problems related to temperament, social or environmental. Family history needs to be closely examined to fully understand the deep rooted connection between these problems.<\/p>\n<p>People suffering from both substance abuse and mental health concerns need to find the right balance to cure them of it. They must be actively involved in the decision making process of their own health, thus making them feel powerful and in control, something that has been lacking from their lives.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1961\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1961\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1961\" src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/utah-substance-abuse-treatment.png\" alt=\"Utah Substance Abuse Treatment\" width=\"240\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/utah-substance-abuse-treatment.png 285w, https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/utah-substance-abuse-treatment-240x300.png 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1961\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><center>SOURCE: <a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/mentalMask.jpg\">fresno.ca.us<\/a><\/center><\/p><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"\/programs\/\">Group support<\/a> is considered extremely helpful in these cases as it helps create a trust circle where any and all concerns can be voiced without the risk of being wrongly judged.
