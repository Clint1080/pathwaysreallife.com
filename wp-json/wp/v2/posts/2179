With so many things to juggle at once, it\u2019s not uncommon to feel down during the \u201cmost wonderful time of the year.\u201d Especially for those prone to depression and anxiety, November and December can be particularly difficult to navigate with a smile.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>What causes the holiday blues? Everybody\u2019s different, and the triggers vary. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.glamour.com\/entertainment\/2015\/10\/sarah-silverman-on-i-smile-back-and-battle-with-depression\">As comedian Sarah Silverman describes depression<\/a>, \u201cit feels like it\u2019s coming over me like a flu.\u201d Depression can be as sudden and unexpected as any other illness. Sometimes it hits us when we least expect it \u2013 and it\u2019s never convenient or fun.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I can only speak from my own experience, and I would say that the depression I experienced feels like a chemical change,\" she said. &#8220;When it came over me, when it comes over me, it feels like it&#8217;s coming over me like a flu. You ever just sit &#8230; and you&#8217;re fine and the next moment you just go, &#8216;Oh, Jesus, I have the flu.'\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>However, there are some common factors you can be aware of that add unwanted stress during the holiday season:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fatigue<\/li>\n<li>Unrealistic expectations<\/li>\n<li>Constant commercialization<\/li>\n<li>Visitors and family reunions<\/li>\n<li>Distance from friends or family<\/li>\n<li>Parties<\/li>\n<li>Traffic<\/li>\n<li>Drastic changes in weather<\/li>\n<li>and more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In fact, many people who rarely suffer from stress have reported headaches, insomnia, and other stress symptoms\u00a0during the holidays. This annual visit from depression and anxiety leaves its mark and darkens what\u00a0could otherwise be a bright time of joy.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that, with some focused preparation, you can find that joy again. Follow these tips to bid the holiday blues farewell:<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5\">Plan Ahead\u2026<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/holiday-tips.jpg\" alt=\"Plan ahead so you don't fall behind. If you know you will have anxiety during the holidays, plan for it.\" width=\"407\" height=\"612\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 0px\" \/>You know it\u2019s coming, and that gives you the upper hand on depression and anxiety. This season, devote some time to creating restorative routines. Identify what calms you and build that into your regular schedule. Read a book. Chat with a friend. Take a nap. Make these priorities so they never get skipped during your busy day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For your travel.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to feel relaxed when you have to rush to the airport or train station, wondering all the way whether you\u2019ve left something important at home. Get your arrangements booked as early as possible and confirm them to make sure your transportation, hotel, rental car, and other necessities are in order. Prepare extra time to pack and double check your tickets, identification, and medications so you can head out with confidence.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For your feelings.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The holidays are actually designed to encourage a variety of feelings. Some are joyful, but others tend to open the door to negativity if you aren\u2019t careful. Remind yourself that quiet contemplation on your feelings \u2013 all of them \u2013 is normal and healthy, especially at this time of year. Write down things that upset you and answer questions like \u201cWhat do I wish were happening instead?\u201d This conversation with yourself can actually help manage depression.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For your health.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We know you\u2019re slammed with tons of things to do. For many of us, it\u2019s tempting to let exercise take a back seat to more urgent priorities. The reality, though, is that exercise is one of the best natural mood\u00a0enhancers\u00a0available, and lack of exercise is one of the strongest ingredients for anxiety. Do your body and your emotions a favor and take that brisk walk as often as you can.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For your relationships.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Most of us have at least one Grinch in our lives. Think ahead about how to defuse potentially negative situations with your family\u2019s source of conflict. You can prepare a bank of polite responses that allow you to end the conversation or delay it until you\u2019ve calmed down. Try positive statements like \u201cMaybe we can talk about this again later\u201d or \u201cThanks for letting me know how you feel.\u201d Then get back to enjoying your day, argument-free.<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5\">Make New Traditions<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Traditions are a source of joy for many people, but sometimes our traditions cause us stress. Maybe they remind us of sad things. Maybe they won\u2019t fit into everyone\u2019s schedule this year.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s okay. The best thing about traditions is that they are flexible. They grow with you and your family. Don\u2019t be afraid to change things up this year if it will help you heal.<\/p>\n<p>Some family members will be excited to try something new, but not everyone is comfortable with change. This is also fine. Be considerate of your family\u2019s feelings, and make any adjustments to traditions gently and with kindness. Positivity is the theme for this season!<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5\">Focus on What Matters Most<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/christmas-depression-treatment.jpg\" alt=\"The parent child relationship is very important when trying to beat depression and anxiety\" width=\"400\" height=\"227\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 0px\" \/>Spoiler alert: it\u2019s not the presents, it is love and friendship.<\/p>\n<p>Some people will choose to give expensive presents because they have money to spare, but little free time. They may choose to show their love by buying gifts.<\/p>\n<p>Others may not have a lot of money to spare, but they will devote their energy to creating personal gifts at home. They\u2019re showing love in their way.<\/p>\n<p>Both the expensive presents\u00a0and the hand-made gifts are equally valuable.<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5\">Say No Sometimes<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s so easy to overburden yourself during the holidays. Give yourself the freedom to say no to a few invitations. Let your friends know you\u2019re grateful they thought of you, but you already have another obligation \u2013 even if that obligation is actually private time with yourself!<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5\">Eat and Drink Responsibly<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Try feasting slowly; our brains take a few minutes to catch up to our stomachs, and sometimes we feel hungry for a short while after we\u2019re actually full. There\u2019s no need to fill your plate on your first trip. If you\u2019re still hungry several minutes after eating, you can always get seconds!<\/p>\n<p>Also, remember that alcohol can make your emotions more intense than usual. Keep this in mind when you\u2019re breaking out the wine or egg nog this holiday season. Have whatever is a reasonable amount for you, but listen to your body. Relax and take it slowly.<\/p>\n<p>With careful preparation, positivity, and focused attention to your body and emotional needs, you can take this tricky time of year and turn it into the glowing, joyful season.<\/p>\n<h2>Depression Treatment Utah<\/h2>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Depression-Treatment-Utah.jpg\" alt=\"Pathways Real Life Recovery offers treatment for depression from our 2 convenient Utah locations: one in Sandy, Utah and in Tooele, Utah.
