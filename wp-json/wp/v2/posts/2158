The cost of setting up a solid family support system is seen as one of the major obstacles. Families are also not viewed as \u2018patients\u2019 that need to be tested and monitored. The fact is drug addiction can cause a tremendous amount of stress on the family.

This statement is anchored on the belief that the entire family has a far-reaching influence on a child\u2019s total development. In line with this principle is the need to examine how drug addiction impacts families especially when it comes to teen pregnancy, divorce, juvenile delinquency, and physical and emotional abuse.<\/p>\n<p>Statistical records show that fifty percent of the 35.6 million children in the United States live with someone who either drinks alcohol or uses illegal substances. Here are some of possible risks associated with drug addiction.<\/p>\n<h3><b>1) Stigma<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>A child\u2019s social relationship suffers greatly especially when the news of a loved one dealing with addiction has already reached the ears of friends, classmates, and teachers. Studies show that in most instances, teachers tend to attribute a student\u2019s slow academic progress to a parent\u2019s drug problems. On the other hand, peers may also treat someone more differently. This conduct could disrupt interpersonal relationships.<\/p>\n<h3><b>2) Moral Development<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Research also shows that early exposures to drug-related criminal activities within the family can severely hamper a child\u2019s moral development. At an early age, a child may witness inappropriate activities that could distort his or her outlook in life. On top of this, children of drug users may have a higher chance of using illegal substances in the future.<\/p>\n<h3><b>3) Abuse<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Health experts have already warned the public about the physical and psychological <a href=\"http:\/\/www.casacolumbia.org\/articlefiles\/380-family%20matters.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">consequences<\/a> of alcohol and drug addiction. For instance, an addicted parent may suffer bouts of hallucinations, depress, paranoia, and anxiety. These symptoms could eventually lead to abusive behaviors thereby putting children at risk for physical and emotional abuse.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, various government organizations, decision makers, and private funders have come up with compelling arguments to support the role of families in the treatment of drug addiction.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2161\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2161\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/salt-lake-city-addiction-recovery.png\" alt=\"Salt Lake City Addiction Recovery\" width=\"300\" height=\"183\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2161\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">What are the best ways to overcome addiction? &#8211; Source<\/p><\/div> <center>What are the best ways to overcome addiction? &#8211; <a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/Addiction-Recovery.jpg\">Source<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\"><b>Recommendations<\/b><\/h2>\n<h4><b>Education<\/b><\/h4>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Families must be given ample support to learn, understand, and recognize signs and symptoms of addiction in the family.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Intervention<\/b><\/h4>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Since addiction can quickly sap someone\u2019s nurturing instincts, constant encouragement and medical help must be sought to speed up the treatment and recovery process and also  to prevent unsafe behaviors.
