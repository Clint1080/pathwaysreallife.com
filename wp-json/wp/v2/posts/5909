There are typical obstacles that dishearten many people suffering from alcohol or drug addiction, causing them to <a title=\"Steps to Take if Your Loved One Is Unwilling to Seek Help\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/what-to-do-if-an-addict-is-unwilling-to-seek-help\/\">avoid seeking treatment<\/a> or doubt their likelihood of lasting success after rehab. In some cases, individuals face a combination of these barriers to entering a substance abuse program. But, every individual who needs alcohol or drug addiction treatment should be able and willing to receive it.<\/p>\n<p>Although some people succeed in turning away from abusing drugs or alcohol with just support from friends or family, there are over 20 million individuals struggling with addiction in the United States who need treatment in a substance abuse center in order to overcome their dependency. In those cases, their addiction may be too extreme, or they may have a strong genetic predisposition, or there may be mental health factors or other issues which require help from rehab professionals.<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Why Don\u2019t People Who Need Rehab Seek Treatment?<\/h2>\n<p>It can be extremely difficult for some people to face the prospect of starting drug or <a title=\"Why Choose Pathways?- Best Substance Abuse Treatment Program in Utah\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/why-pathways\/\">alcohol rehabilitation treatments<\/a>. Some have severe cravings or even withdrawal symptoms that can intimidate them from facing the process of overcoming their addiction. Others may try to hide their addiction, because of the stigma it bears in their community around them. These are just a few of the many reasons why people avoid starting treatment.<\/p>\n<p>The voluminous report of the <em><a title=\"National Survey on Drug Use and Health- SAMHSA, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality\" href=\"https:\/\/www.samhsa.gov\/data\/sites\/default\/files\/NSDUH-DetTabs2014\/NSDUH-DetTabs2014.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health<\/a><\/em>, from DHHS\u2019s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), offers data on reasons why people do not seek treatment for substance addiction (2011-2014). The research found that among the most frequent reasons people in need of rehab treatment did not seek help included:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>8% said they believe they can quit using on their own.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>39% did not think they could afford to go to rehab.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>17% feared being in rehab would impact their jobs.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>18% wanted to avoid the stigma of admitting addiction.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Overcoming Barriers To Addiction Treatment<\/h2>\n<p>In some cases, people don\u2019t seek addiction treatment for a combination of reasons. They may believe they can\u2019t afford treatment. Or, they might be too fearful of telling their employer they need to go into rehab. Maybe they\u2019re worried about being absent from work, or a lack of childcare or they may feel unable to get help due to any one of many other concerns. Here are just a few of the most common examples of concerns people have about seeking treatment for substance abuse:<\/p>\n<h3>They Don\u2019t Believe They Have a Serious Problem<\/h3>\n<p>Over a third of people with substance addiction believe they\u2019re not addicted or that they can stop using drugs or alcohol whenever they want to, without help. They often don\u2019t see the harm their behavior is causing to their important relationships, their employment, and other areas of their lives.<\/p>\n<p>Recognizing their need for substance abuse treatment is the necessary awakening that enables them to turn toward a new life beyond addiction, starting with getting the help they need to free themselves from substance abuse and move on to a more fulfilling life.<\/p>\n<h3>They Believe Rehab Costs Too Much<\/h3>\n<p>Many people struggling with addiction don\u2019t think they can afford rehab. Generally, drug addiction rehabilitation experts recommend a minimum of 90 days<a title=\"Pathways Residential Inpatient Rehab Center for Drug &#038; Alcohol Addiction\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/inpatient-drug-and-alcohol-rehab\/\"> inpatient treatment<\/a> in cases of severe substance addiction.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that these days many drug treatment centers base the cost of rehab on a person\u2019s income. Some drug and alcohol rehab facilities also receive government funding, enabling them to reduce the cost of treatment for people seeking rehab.<\/p>\n<h3>They Can\u2019t Leave Their Responsibilities<\/h3>\n<p>Over 75% of people with drug or alcohol addiction in the United States are afraid they will lose their jobs while they\u2019re away in rehab. Sufficient time in rehab means a greater likelihood of <a title=\"General Outpatient Program Utah- We Accept Most Insurance Plans and Offer Financing Options\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/general-outpatient-program\/\">long-term recovery success<\/a> and less risk of relapse.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, many employers today are supportive of their employees\u2019 decision to obtain treatment for addiction and welcome them back to their jobs after they complete inpatient rehab. Alternatively, <a title=\"Intensive Outpatient Program Utah- Customized Addiction Treatment Plans Available\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/outpatient-recovery\/\">outpatient addiction treatment<\/a> is an effective option for many people, and it makes it possible for them to avoid missing time on their jobs.<\/p>\n<h3>They Don\u2019t Have Sufficient Childcare Resources<\/h3>\n<p>A serious issue for many individuals coping with addiction is the absence of adequate child care options. It can be a very tough decision to entrust the care of one\u2019s child to another person. But, the choice to recover from addiction is the most important thing a parent can do for their child and herself or himself, making it the right decision in every case of substance addiction.<\/p>\n<p>After all, the alternative is potentially allowing alcohol or drug addiction to cause job loss and loss of child custody. Recovering from addiction is the most practical way to avoid those outcomes and do your best for your child.<\/p>\n<h3>They\u2019re Worried About the Stigma of Addiction and Rehab<\/h3>\n<p>Nearly 20% of individuals who do not seek addiction treatment say their worried about their reputation. They fear what their spouse, family, neighbors, coworkers, employers, and others in their community will think of them if they go into drug or alcohol rehab. They naturally fear social judgment, because addiction is stigmatized in the U.S. However, contrary to their fears, the majority of families and friends want their loved ones to recover from addiction and not go on suffering with it.<\/p>\n<h3>There Is No Treatment Program in Their Area<\/h3>\n<p>A serious obstacle to treatment for substance addiction is often the lack of treatment options. The need for rehab is accelerating more rapidly than new treatment facilities are opening throughout the country. In cities, rehab facilities often have lengthy waiting lists for admission, and in <a title=\"Alcohol and Drug Rehab Treatment Center Service Areas\" href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/alcohol-and-drug-rehab-treatment-center-service-areas\/\">rural areas<\/a>, people seeking addiction treatment are sometimes forced to travel many miles for treatment.<\/p>\n<p>There are some effective alternatives, including seeking help from a person\u2019s family doctor. They can attend support groups, and they can start in AA or Narcotics Anonymous while waiting to begin rehab.<\/p>\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5910\" src=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Overcoming-Obstacles-to-Substance-Abuse-Treatment.jpg\" title=\"Most Common Barriers to Substance Abuse Treatment &#038; Tips to Overcome Them\" alt=\"Infographic- Overcoming Obstacles to Substance Abuse Treatment in Utah\" width=\"600\" height=\"1500\" \/><\/h2>\n<h2>Asking for the Help You Need Is the Smart Choice<\/h2>\n<p>There are countless reasons for not seeking treatment for substance addiction, but you don\u2019t need to wait until things are much worse before you reach out and ask for the help you need.
