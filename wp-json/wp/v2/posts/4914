The day was set aside to <strong><em>raise awareness of drug overdose and reduce the stigma<\/em><\/strong> that is associated with such incidences of overdosing. The overdose awareness day is also celebrated to <strong><em>acknowledge the grief that is felt by numerous families and friends globally who gather to remember their loved ones<\/em><\/strong>. International Overdose Awareness Day seeks to spread the message that the tragedy of overdose death is preventable and participants are encouraged to wear a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.overdoseday.com\/shop\/\">silver badge or wristband<\/a> to show their support for overdose awareness.<\/p>\n<p>Statistics indicate that they were approximately 200,000 drug-related deaths in 2016. The United States alone accounts for more than 25 percent of the estimated number of drug-related deaths worldwide. In fact, the number of drug overdose-related cases in the United States has tripled between 2000 and 2017 with more than 55,000 people dying from fatal drug overdoses every year.<\/p>\n<h2>Drug Overdose Is a Global Problem<\/h2>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Drug overdose is an increasing international problem that medical experts are worried about. According to a report by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drug overdose is among the leading cause of drug-related deaths in the U.S. <strong><em>A majority of the drug overdose deaths happen as a result of opioid abuse<\/em><\/strong>. The term opioid refer to a class of drugs that has<strong><em> both legal and illegal substances<\/em><\/strong>. Most people use prescribed opioids that slow down the central nervous system to produce a calming effect.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Opioids are mostly prescribed to reduce pain, but most people end up taking the drug for recreational purposes which <\/em><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/pathwaysreallife.com\/prescription-drug-abuse-treatment-utah\/\"><strong><em>leads to addiction<\/em><\/strong><\/a>. When taken in large quantities, opioids can depress certain functions such as normal breathing and heartbeat until they eventually stop leading to death.<\/p>\n<h2>Symptoms of Overdose<\/h2>\n<p>Medical practitioners define drug overdose as the intentional or accidental use of a particular drug or substance such as alcohol beyond the recommended dosage. <strong><em>A drug overdose can have severe consequences with its effects ranging from brain injury, disorientation to seizures and death.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Part of the overdose awareness day agenda is to facilitate spread of information on <strong><em>how to identify signs and symptoms<\/em><\/strong> of substance abuse and overdose and <strong><em>what you can do to help <\/em><\/strong>the affected individuals. The typical signs of drug overdose include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pinpoint pupils<\/li>\n<li>Shallow breathing or breathing that has completely stopped<\/li>\n<li>Gray\/blue lips or fingertips<\/li>\n<li>Agitation<\/li>\n<li>Vomiting<\/li>\n<li>No response to stimuli<\/li>\n<li>Unusual snoring<\/li>\n<li>Disorientation<\/li>\n<li>Inability to rouse<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Show Your Support: Attend Overdose Awareness Day Events in Salt Lake City, Utah<\/h2>\n<p>The International Overdose Awareness Day will take place at the South Steps of the Utah State Capitol on 31<sup>st<\/sup> August 2018 between 6 and 9 pm.
