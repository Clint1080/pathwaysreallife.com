<p>Telehealthcare adoption by both patients and doctors soared in 2020. The <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/covid-19-update/">COVID-19</a> pandemic caused the need for a rapid shift in the way people access healthcare. The accelerated evolution of virtual healthcare is reflected in statistics from some of the world’s most respected researchers and consolidated in a data report from Wheel Health, Inc. The report highlights key 2020 medical industry trends. <em>The telehealth statistics below illustrate the spectacular transformation of U.S. healthcare services in just one year, through virtual care adoption. </em>The <em>patient satisfaction</em> data are especially remarkable.</p>



<span id="more-6005"></span>

<h2 id="Escalating-Rates-of-Telehealthcare">Escalating Rates of Telehealthcare Use</h2>



<p>According to the CDC, telemedicine usage increased 154% in March 2020 from the same period in the prior year. Now, 46% of patients use telemedicine for some of their doctor visits, up from just 11% in 2019, and nearly half of physicians are treating patients through telemedicine.</p>



<p>2020 spurred the sudden widespread need for telemedical services, due to quarantine orders and public concerns about safety from the coronavirus. Health care providers quickly moved to meet the high demand for virtual care and maximize the use of online patient visits. Since early 2020:</p>



<ul><li>There has been a 57% increase in the number of patients who have had at least one telehealth visit.</li><li>The majority of telehealth patients over the past year were between ages 18 to 49, according to the CDC, per the Wheel report.</li><li>83% of people who received telehealthcare in the past year said they will probably continue using it.</li></ul>



<h2 id="Patient-Satisfaction-With-Virtual">Patient Satisfaction With Virtual Healthcare</h2>



<p>Sustained high rates of patient satisfaction with telehealthcare have validated this medical care delivery model. In fact, according to a J.D. Power report, telehealthcare patient satisfaction levels rank with the highest in the healthcare industry.</p>



<ul><li>An extraordinary 77% of patients reported that they were highly satisfied with their virtual healthcare, largely due to the convenience, speed of access, and safety in at-home visits.</li><li>75% said they want to make telemedicine a routine part of their healthcare.</li><li>50% of patients surveyed said they would be willing to change providers in order to have routine virtual health services.</li><li>91% of people surveyed said they believed that virtual medical care can help with prescription compliance or keeping appointments.</li></ul>



<h2 id="Specialized-Telemedicine">Specialized Telemedicine Use</h2>



<p>Telehealthcare adoption has been especially high in routine treatment for chronic diseases as well as in mental and behavioral health. By mid-spring of 2020, a stunning 97% of primary health care providers were treating patients via telemedicine.</p>



<ul><li>According to the <em>Journal of the American College of Cardiology</em>, within only two weeks in 2020, 75% of outpatient cardiology care visits switched to virtual appointments.</li><li><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/11-ways-behavioral-health-services-help-people-with-telemedicine/">Behavioral health</a> is the top medical specialty currently utilizing telehealth, with rheumatology and endocrinology also in the top three.</li><li>Of <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/mental-health-services/">mental and behavioral health specialists</a>, <em>94%</em> report that they want to continue providing treatment via telehealth delivery.</li></ul>



<h2 id="The-Future-of-Virtual">The Future of Virtual Care</h2>



<p>Since physicians nationwide were forced into rapid adoption of telemedical practices with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic early last year, over 75% of doctors surveyed say telehealth has helped provide improved patient care.</p>



<p>This outcome is confirmed by reports of patient satisfaction with the telehealth services model, which have been overwhelmingly positive over the past year. As a result, telemedicine has quickly grown into a big subsegment of the medical industry — currently predicted to be a patient care component worth $106 billion by next year (2023).</p>



<p>There are great advantages for both patients and doctors in routine care and virtual urgent care. These include the major benefits of flexibility for healthcare providers to start and scale medical teleservices to benefit patients. They also include the increased capacity for providers to maintain more convenient services for more patients that meet the high-quality standards of modern U.S. health care consumers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><p class="ffb-id-pk3copb fg-paragraph text-left    fg-text-dark">If your young child is experiencing <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/adult-teen-adolescent-behavioral-health-clinic-utah/" title="Behavioral Health Treatment for Adults and Teens in Utah - Parent-Child Interaction Therapy near Salt Lake City Utah">behavioral problems</a>, you have likely tried many methods to attempt to correct these behaviors. Some of these methods may include punishment techniques or positive reinforcement methods. However, if you are not seeing any change in their behavior, you may begin to wonder what you as a parent are doing wrong.</p>
<p><span id="more-4347"></span></p>
<p>Despite your best efforts to remain calm and composed, parents can become tired and irritable when they are subjected to the same behaviors from their child over and over. When this happens, you may not act in such a way that we are making a positive impact on our child as they are disciplined. Unfortunately, your child can then pick up on your bad habits and mirror them, which may be part of the reason that they are acting out, because they see you doing so when you are frustrated. A parent&#8217;s frustration and stress directly relate to our children&#8217;s ability to <a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/belief-restructuring/" title="Belief Restructuring Therapy - Parent-Child Interaction Therapist in Utah">process and react to their feelings and behaviors</a>. If you are in this situation, parent-child interaction therapy, or PCIT, may be ideal for you.<br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4344" src="https://pathwaysreallife.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-child-interaction-therapy-pcit-utah.jpg" alt="Parent Child Interaction Therapy" width="600" height="400" title="Experience the benefits of parent child relationship therapy, call Pathways Real Life Recovery today - Parent Child Interaction Therapy in Utah" /><br />&nbsp;</br></p>
<p><a href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/parent-child-therapy/" title="Parent-child Interaction Therapy near Salt Lake City Utah - What are the benefits of parent child relationship therapy?">Parent-child interaction therapy</a> is a form of therapy for you, the parent. You receive coaching from a child psychology specialist on how to decrease your negative behaviors while improving upon your relationship with your child. This can help to curb behavioral problems in a child. PCIT is a specialized 15-20 session treatment program designed for parents or caregivers and their children aged 10 or younger who may be experiencing behavioral and/or emotional issues. Sessions are an hour long and are done weekly.</p>
<h2>Helps Children Manage Aggressive and Defiant Behaviors</h2>
<p>Parent-child interaction counseling helps target a wide range of <a href="http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/aggression/according-experts/effective-daycare-kindergarten-interventions-prevent-chronic-aggression">aggressive</a> and defiant behaviors in children. Some of those behaviors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swearing</li>
<li>Fighting</li>
<li>Temper tantrums</li>
<li>Refusal to obey rules</li>
<li>Arguing</li>
<li>Low self-esteem</li>
<li>Low frustration threshold</li>
<li>Lying</li>
<li>Blaming others for one&#8217;s actions</li>
</ul>
<p>With such a wide array of behaviors, you may be wondering how this type of counseling can help to solve all of these problems. In order to properly solve behavioral issues, you have to get to the root of the issue with the child. Most of the time, the behavior is one that is learned from the parent and the parent may inadvertently be doing so. For example, when you discipline your child, and they talk back, you may engage with them and argue. If you let them get away with this a couple of times, the habit is formed and it is hard to break without outside assistance. Learning how to break some of these bad habits, and learning techniques to follow yourself when you feel frustrated, will help your child see how to behave in situations. Over time, they will learn by your positive example.</p>
<p><div class="su-quote su-quote-style-default su-quote-has-cite"><div class="su-quote-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim">Research has shown that, as a result of PCIT, parents learn more effective parenting techniques, the behavior problem of children decrease, and the quality of the parent-child relationship improves.<span class="su-quote-cite">(U.S. Department of Human and Health Services, 2015)</span></div></div></p>
<h2>Helps Improve Parent-Child Relationships</h2>
<p>One of the biggest benefits to parent-child interaction therapy is that you can improve upon your relationship with your child. Many parents would love a better relationship with their child, but they simply don&#8217;t know how. This type of program teaches you how to communicate with and respect your child, while still asserting your parental position. Creating and establishing a positive relationship is much easier in younger children, so the earlier you start, the better.</p>
<h2>Helps Reduce Child Abuse</h2>
<p>The last benefit to parent-child interaction therapy is that it helps to <a href="http://encompassnw.org/parent-child-interaction-therapy-decreases-tension-and-improves-relationships/">reduce child abuse</a>. When parents are frustrated, they can say things that can be hurtful and emotionally abusive to a child. Unfortunately, they may not even realize because that&#8217;s how they were disciplined as a child. PCIT breaks the cycle of abuse and teaches you how to parent without emotionally or physically abusing your child.</p>

<p>The practice of mindfulness originated in traditional Buddhist strategies of <em>training one’s own mind</em> to operate healthily and in greater harmony with one’s experience of existential reality. Over the generations, fostering the self-discipline of mindfulness has made its way into various Western therapies, due to its demonstrated physical and <a title="Practicing Mindfulness for Overcoming Obstacles to Substance Abuse Treatment" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/overcoming-obstacles-to-substance-abuse-treatment/">mental health benefits</a>.</p>



<h2 id="What-is">What is Mindfulness?</h2>



<p>Mindfulness is the simple yet challenging mental practice of <em>being aware</em> of your own thoughts in the moment and of your experiences of your world and your engagements with it — without judging them. It’s about <em>responding</em> instead of <em>reacting</em> to the occurrences that present themselves to you through the moments and days of your life. It involves a developed skill in tracking one’s mental activities, emotional feelings, and physical sensations.</p>



<p><em>Some important benefits of exercising mindfulness are:</em></p>

<h2 id="Misconceptions-of">Misconceptions of Mindfulness</h2>



<p>The point of practicing mindfulness is not to reach a <em>blank</em> mental state. On the contrary, it is about being <em>more </em>aware, more fully <em>present</em>. It is about sharpening one’s awareness of moments and thoughts and emotions and sensations. The point is to embrace awareness, not <em>expel</em> awareness from the mind. It is an exercise in curiosity about <em>all</em> that passes through the consciousness, and in freeing the mind from judgement about any of it.</p>



<p>Although <em>mindfulness</em> is a part of various forms of <em>meditation</em>, the two are not the <em>same</em> thing. Meditation is a dedicated activity, planned and executed, whereas mindfulness is best understood as a developed <em>way of thinking about your thoughts and experiences as they are occurring</em>. It’s a practice of observing and accepting one’s own perceptions of reality in everyday life.</p>



<h2 id="Why-Is-Mindfulness-Hard-to">Why Is Mindfulness Hard to Achieve?</h2>



<p>Today’s social and professional atmosphere can seem like immersion in a state of rapid and constant change. The persistent high energy and sense of perpetual rushing can cause a sense of disequilibrium, often leading to anxiety and even consequences of mental and emotional overload. The relentless daily exposure to it all can be a lot to manage <em>and</em> keep a sense of balance, peace, and contentment.</p>



<p>Self-therapeutic focus on building a richer and more objective awareness of one’s self and world (mindfulness), along with cultivating a mindset of <a title="The Neuroscience of Gratitude and How It Affects Anxiety and Grief" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/the-neuroscience-of-gratitude-and-how-it-affects-anxiety-and-grief/">gratitude</a> involves adopting <a title="Rewiring Your Brain to be Happier- Practicing Mindfulness" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/rewiring-your-brain-to-be-happier/">new ways of thinking</a>. Observing our thoughts and ways of processing our experiences require slowing down enough to experience the present more fully.</p>



<p>That can feel awkward for people who have recently come to practicing mindfulness. Like any other skill, it takes <em>practice</em> to master it, and every individual must try some techniques to discover which ones are most effective for him/her. Fortunately, it’s fun to do, so it’s soothing just to keep <em>trying</em> to exercise our own techniques for mindful self-observation.</p>



<p>Even better, there’s no possibility of failure while you’re <em>trying</em> to be mindful. In efforts at mindfulness, trying <em>is</em> succeeding. In other words, to <em>try</em> to focus on being mindful is what it is to <em>be</em> mindful in that moment.</p>



<h2 id="Mindfulness-for-Help-in-Trauma">Mindfulness for Help in Trauma Recovery</h2>



<p>Moving through life at high speed is a manner of coping for many people struggling with the <a title="Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment in Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd-treatment-in-utah/">effects of past trauma</a>. Practicing mindfulness offers an important tool for helping overcome the often long-lasting effects of trauma. Each person can choose a level of practice to imbue daily consciousness with greater mindfulness.</p>



<p>In making the effort toward more mindful living, each person can be anticipated to find and enjoy his/her <em>own</em> level and comfortable pace of the practice. It can be as easy as closing your eyes and or just sitting quietly and intentionally <em>listening to your own thoughts and feelings</em>, without judging them as they flow through you.</p>



<p>Being mindful is being fully <em>present</em> in your environment, being fully <em>aware</em> of your mental, emotional, and physical responses to it, and discovering that you are feeling comfortable with yourself.</p>



<h2 id="Mindfulness-for-Help-in-Relapse">Mindfulness for Help in Relapse Prevention</h2>



<p>Practicing powerful techniques for developing a habit of mindfulness can help people suffering from substance abuse disorder, anxiety, <a title="Treat Severe Depression- Mindfulness is One of The Key" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/its-time-to-change-the-way-we-view-and-treat-severe-depression/">depression</a>, and other <a title="Mental Health Services We Provide at Pathways" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/mental-health-services/">mental health issues</a>.</p>



<p>One vast value of mindfulness is its effectiveness in a person’s efforts toward training his or her own mind to navigate through challenging thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations without reacting to them by practicing unhealthy or even self-destructive behaviors.</p>



<p>An extraordinarily beneficial effect of training one’s own mind to sustain a state of increased mindfulness is a greater ability to detect initial <a title="Mindfulness-Based Drug &amp; Alcohol Relapse Prevention (MBRP)" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/relapse-prevention-utah/">signs of relapse</a> risk by observing your own thoughts, emotions, and physical experience.</p>



<p><em>Practicing</em> <em>awareness</em> of what you are experiencing in these ways can empower you to recognize and respond to early signs of oncoming internal derailing that has led to substance abuse in the past. <em>Using</em> your mindfulness this way can be very powerful in helping sustain addiction recovery. It also enables us to show <em>self-compassion</em> even if relapse occurs. It further helps a person more adeptly bring himself or herself back out of substance abuse <em>sooner</em>, and with even better-developed tools for more lasting success in sobriety going forward.</p>



<h2 id="How-Can-I-Practice">How Can I Practice Mindfulness?</h2>



<p>Practicing mindfulness is a very simple matter of quieting the mind and paying attention to your thoughts as they flow into and out of your mind. It’s just observing your thoughts as they come and go. This is what it is to just <em>be present</em>, also known as to <em>live in the moment</em>. It’s a way to inner balance and greater happiness.</p>



<p>Of course, being <em>simple</em> doesn’t mean it’s <em>easy</em>. It does take practice to eventually find oneself more automatically maintaining an ongoing state of mindfulness. So, practice for a few minutes each day, until you find it becoming a more frequent habit. Strengthen your newly developing habit by continuing to practice it <em>intentionally</em> during times when you find you have drifted out of the mindset.</p>



<p>Continue this process until you find yourself eventually living more continuously in a mindful state. But, mindfulness is naturally an <em>endeavor</em> — with progress for those who continue the practice — not a permanent accomplishment. Take comfort in that fact as you embark on an ever-aspiring life-long journey of gently coaxing your mind into greater extents of mindful awareness.</p>



<h2 id="External-Aids-for-Cultivating">External Aids for Cultivating Mindfulness</h2>



<p>Practicing mindfulness can be challenging in our busy lives and fast-paced environment, but we have the benefit of a great wealth of <a title="Contact Our Experts to Know the Benefits of Mindfulness" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/">resources for cultivating mindfulness</a>. If it helps, you might try attending organized mindfulness group sessions. There are also abundant group meditation opportunities. Or, just walk, sit, lie down, bike, or do something else that helps you free your consciousness to use the activity for focusing your awareness on all the thoughts and sensations you experience while engaged in it.</p>



<p>Modern technologies offer additional resources for developing mindfulness. For example, you can watch online instructional videos and podcasts offering mindfulness guidance. There are even free apps to aid in meditation, and others for developing and practicing mindfulness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Untreated mental illness is a crisis in the United States. According to the National Institute of Health (NIH) Over <a title="Mental Illness- National Institute of Mental Health" href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20there%20were%20an,20.6%25%20of%20all%20U.S.%20adults." target="_blank" rel="noopener">20% of adults</a> in the country have a mental illness, but only around 45% of those receive behavioral healthcare (2019). The lack of local access to mental health services, cost of treatment, societal stigma, and other factors contribute to the widespread inability to get treatment. Telehealthcare removes obstacles to receiving mental health care. Virtual therapy sessions are enabling more and more people with mental health issues to succeed in their lives.</p>
<p><span id="more-5931"></span></p>
<h2>Suffering Without Mental Health Treatment</h2>
<p>People with untreated mental illness often suffer from social isolation, loss of key relationships, and difficulty maintaining employment. In addition to their loss of human connections, there are numerous potential <a title="Dual Diagnosis Treatment for Co-Occurring Disorders in Utah - Pathways Residential Inpatient Treatment Services in Glenwood, Utah - Residential Rehab Treatment in Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/dual-diagnosis-treatment-co-occuring-disorders-utah/">comorbidities with mental illness</a>. These can include sleep disorders, depression, <a title="Customized Addiction Treatment Programs Available- We Accept Most Insurance Plans and Offer Financing Options" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/programs/">drug or alcohol addiction</a>, heart disease, gastrointestinal problems, obesity, and others.</p>
<h2>How Can Telemedicine Support Mental Health?</h2>
<h3>More Available Therapists</h3>
<p>Using telemedicine to deliver <a title="Behavioral Health Treatment Services- Anxiety, Depression, Grief, Trauma, Abuse, Marriage, Family, And Addiction Issues" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/mental-health-services/">mental health care</a> can help reduce the current shortage of mental health treatment providers. From licensed therapists to psychiatrists, mental health care specialists’ availability is decreasing throughout the country. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services research predicts that there will be an increasing shortage of mental health care providers over the coming years. The DHHS predicts that shortages will become severe in multiple areas of services by 2025. With the ability to provide care by telehealth appointment, healthcare professionals can more effectively maximize availability.</p>
<h3>Ease of Treatment Access</h3>
<p>Meeting with the therapist remotely, instead of being required to drive to the medical office eliminates the burden of commuting to therapy. This can enable busy parents, rural patients, overworked professionals, small business sole proprietors, handicapped patients, elderly people, patients without vehicles, and others to attend therapy.</p>
<h3>More Cost-Efficient Treatment</h3>
<p>Virtual care can be expected to be more cost-effective for providers and patients. Paying for teletherapy, vs. treatment at a medical office or emergency room can be more affordable for uninsured patients and those who have exceeded their maximum insurance benefits for mental health care. Plus, transportation, child care, lost work, and other costs for treatment are eliminated.</p>
<h3>More Consistent Treatment</h3>
<p>For many people who need mental health treatment, their personal circumstances are unstable, leading to disruptions of their mental health care routines. For example, they may struggle with job losses, financial distress, eviction, unexpected relocation, broken primary relationships, and other shocks to their mental health care routine. With virtual treatment sessions, the patient can more easily continue with a therapist, even when their personal circumstances change.</p>
<h3>Less Stressful to Dual-Diagnosed Patients</h3>
<p>People with comorbidities account for a staggering 70% of all patients of behavioral healthcare providers. Patients requiring multiple forms of medical treatment like addiction and combined therapies are met with special challenges. They must cope with multiple health conditions simultaneously and meet more intensive attendance demands if they want to receive all the treatment they need. Virtual treatment sessions make it possible for them to receive more therapy with less physically demanding attendance.</p>
<h3>Helps Therapists Develop Deeper Insights</h3>
<p>Mental healthcare providers can naturally develop deeper insights into patients’ problems and solutions when they can meet with them virtually in their homes. Spending time in the patient’s personal environment allows the <a title="Tips to Choosing a Therapist in Utah Who’s a Good Match for You" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/choosing-a-therapist-in-utah-whos-a-good-match-for-you/">therapist</a> to observe their habits of self-care, their living environment, family dynamics, and other helpful diagnostic and treatment information.</p>
<h3>Ease of Professional Collaboration</h3>
<p>Telecom innovations have made collaboration between mental healthcare providers and relevant specialists much more accessible, for more robust programs of ongoing engagement. This means care providers are no longer relatively isolated from others during treatment. They can now work with other clinicians via virtual sessions, to deliver comprehensive treatment. This approach can reduce the need for hospitalization and enable care providers to manage mental illness, stabilize patients and help prevent escalation of crises that lead to inpatient admissions.</p>
<h3>More Conducive to Patient Bonding</h3>
<p>Receiving mental health care inside the comforting surroundings of their own home can help many patients feel more secure and less apprehensive and self-protective. It can allow them to feel freer to connect at a deeper level of trust and be more open to productive teamwork with their mental health care providers.</p>
<h3>Alleviates Worries About Stigma</h3>
<p>Receiving therapy via telemedicine technology helps reduce the fear of the stigma of mental illness that is common for people with anxiety about being discovered entering a mental health treatment center. That fear causes many patients to avoid seeking the care they need. Telemedicine allows them to utilize mental health services privately, in their own home.</p>
<h3>Enables Remote Addiction Treatment</h3>
<p>Telemedicine is proving effective in providing broader treatment for people afflicted with opioids, methamphetamine, alcohol, and other addictions. Drug and alcohol addiction have become vast national crises in the United States. The problems are as rampant in rural areas as in urban neighborhoods, but the majority of addiction treatment facilities are in or near cities. Treatment sessions via virtual meeting technology can enable people to receive addiction treatment wherever they live.</p>
<h3>Makes Treatment More Affordable</h3>
<p>For women with children, allocating funds for childcare in order to attend therapy is cost-prohibitive. For students and other young people struggling with severely limited finances, senior citizens on a fixed income, and low-income patients, telemedicine makes therapy affordable for more people.</p>
<h2>The Telemedical Mental Health Treatment Solution</h2>
<p>The U.S. healthcare system has been challenged for a long time to meet the country’s ever-increasing needs for access to behavioral healthcare. In fact, insufficient access to mental health treatment has become a serious deficiency in the overall healthcare system over the past decade.</p>
<p>Naturally, telehealth services cannot be expected to resolve all treatment issues for all patients who need help with issues of mental illness. However, advanced technology can accomplish an extraordinary amount of improvement in the system, by helping people connect to the essential <a title="Get Started on Your Pathway to Recovery!- Fill Up This Online Form" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/online-forms/">mental health resources</a> for living healthier lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people who need to seek substance abuse treatment don’t attempt to obtain professional help. There are typical obstacles that dishearten many people suffering from alcohol or drug addiction, causing them to <a title="Steps to Take if Your Loved One Is Unwilling to Seek Help" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/what-to-do-if-an-addict-is-unwilling-to-seek-help/">avoid seeking treatment</a> or doubt their likelihood of lasting success after rehab. In some cases, individuals face a combination of these barriers to entering a substance abuse program. But, every individual who needs alcohol or drug addiction treatment should be able and willing to receive it.</p>
<p>Although some people succeed in turning away from abusing drugs or alcohol with just support from friends or family, there are over 20 million individuals struggling with addiction in the United States who need treatment in a substance abuse center in order to overcome their dependency. In those cases, their addiction may be too extreme, or they may have a strong genetic predisposition, or there may be mental health factors or other issues which require help from rehab professionals.<br />
<span id="more-5909"></span></p>
<h2>Why Don’t People Who Need Rehab Seek Treatment?</h2>
<p>It can be extremely difficult for some people to face the prospect of starting drug or <a title="Why Choose Pathways?- Best Substance Abuse Treatment Program in Utah" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/why-pathways/">alcohol rehabilitation treatments</a>. Some have severe cravings or even withdrawal symptoms that can intimidate them from facing the process of overcoming their addiction. Others may try to hide their addiction, because of the stigma it bears in their community around them. These are just a few of the many reasons why people avoid starting treatment.</p>
<p>The voluminous report of the <em><a title="National Survey on Drug Use and Health- SAMHSA, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality" href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/NSDUH-DetTabs2014/NSDUH-DetTabs2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health</a></em>, from DHHS’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), offers data on reasons why people do not seek treatment for substance addiction (2011-2014). The research found that among the most frequent reasons people in need of rehab treatment did not seek help included:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>8% said they believe they can quit using on their own.</em></li>
<li><em>39% did not think they could afford to go to rehab.</em></li>
<li><em>17% feared being in rehab would impact their jobs.</em></li>
<li><em>18% wanted to avoid the stigma of admitting addiction.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Overcoming Barriers To Addiction Treatment</h2>
<p>In some cases, people don’t seek addiction treatment for a combination of reasons. They may believe they can’t afford treatment. Or, they might be too fearful of telling their employer they need to go into rehab. Maybe they’re worried about being absent from work, or a lack of childcare or they may feel unable to get help due to any one of many other concerns. Here are just a few of the most common examples of concerns people have about seeking treatment for substance abuse:</p>
<h3>They Don’t Believe They Have a Serious Problem</h3>
<p>Over a third of people with substance addiction believe they’re not addicted or that they can stop using drugs or alcohol whenever they want to, without help. They often don’t see the harm their behavior is causing to their important relationships, their employment, and other areas of their lives.</p>
<p>Recognizing their need for substance abuse treatment is the necessary awakening that enables them to turn toward a new life beyond addiction, starting with getting the help they need to free themselves from substance abuse and move on to a more fulfilling life.</p>
<h3>They Believe Rehab Costs Too Much</h3>
<p>Many people struggling with addiction don’t think they can afford rehab. Generally, drug addiction rehabilitation experts recommend a minimum of 90 days<a title="Pathways Residential Inpatient Rehab Center for Drug &#038; Alcohol Addiction" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/inpatient-drug-and-alcohol-rehab/"> inpatient treatment</a> in cases of severe substance addiction.</p>
<p>The good news is that these days many drug treatment centers base the cost of rehab on a person’s income. Some drug and alcohol rehab facilities also receive government funding, enabling them to reduce the cost of treatment for people seeking rehab.</p>
<h3>They Can’t Leave Their Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Over 75% of people with drug or alcohol addiction in the United States are afraid they will lose their jobs while they’re away in rehab. Sufficient time in rehab means a greater likelihood of <a title="General Outpatient Program Utah- We Accept Most Insurance Plans and Offer Financing Options" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/general-outpatient-program/">long-term recovery success</a> and less risk of relapse.</p>
<p>Fortunately, many employers today are supportive of their employees’ decision to obtain treatment for addiction and welcome them back to their jobs after they complete inpatient rehab. Alternatively, <a title="Intensive Outpatient Program Utah- Customized Addiction Treatment Plans Available" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/outpatient-recovery/">outpatient addiction treatment</a> is an effective option for many people, and it makes it possible for them to avoid missing time on their jobs.</p>
<h3>They Don’t Have Sufficient Childcare Resources</h3>
<p>A serious issue for many individuals coping with addiction is the absence of adequate child care options. It can be a very tough decision to entrust the care of one’s child to another person. But, the choice to recover from addiction is the most important thing a parent can do for their child and herself or himself, making it the right decision in every case of substance addiction.</p>
<p>After all, the alternative is potentially allowing alcohol or drug addiction to cause job loss and loss of child custody. Recovering from addiction is the most practical way to avoid those outcomes and do your best for your child.</p>
<h3>They’re Worried About the Stigma of Addiction and Rehab</h3>
<p>Nearly 20% of individuals who do not seek addiction treatment say their worried about their reputation. They fear what their spouse, family, neighbors, coworkers, employers, and others in their community will think of them if they go into drug or alcohol rehab. They naturally fear social judgment, because addiction is stigmatized in the U.S. However, contrary to their fears, the majority of families and friends want their loved ones to recover from addiction and not go on suffering with it.</p>
<h3>There Is No Treatment Program in Their Area</h3>
<p>A serious obstacle to treatment for substance addiction is often the lack of treatment options. The need for rehab is accelerating more rapidly than new treatment facilities are opening throughout the country. In cities, rehab facilities often have lengthy waiting lists for admission, and in <a title="Alcohol and Drug Rehab Treatment Center Service Areas" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/alcohol-and-drug-rehab-treatment-center-service-areas/">rural areas</a>, people seeking addiction treatment are sometimes forced to travel many miles for treatment.</p>
<p>There are some effective alternatives, including seeking help from a person’s family doctor. They can attend support groups, and they can start in AA or Narcotics Anonymous while waiting to begin rehab.</p>

<h2>Asking for the Help You Need Is the Smart Choice</h2>
<p>There are countless reasons for not seeking treatment for substance addiction, but you don’t need to wait until things are much worse before you reach out and ask for the help you need. Addiction treatment and relapse prevention are more likely to be easier and more effective long-term when individuals seek the help they need before their addiction grows more severe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The struggle with depression has spanned across all the eras of humans, affecting all age groups, races, and economic classes. Our understanding of depression has evolved over the centuries. Earlier generations perceived depression as a character weakness or mood problem. Until recently, it was believed to be a mental condition. Current research findings suggest that professionals providing today&#8217;s best treatment for depression will recognize it as an illness of the entire body. Depression has been viewed as a mental illness due to neurological chemical imbalances triggering various symptoms, including feelings of sadness, despair, and tendencies to agonize and sorrowfully dwell on negative thoughts. But, more recent medical evidence suggests that <a title="Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Parameters in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder Compared to Healthy Controls before and after Antidepressant Treatment" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26579881/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression affects the whole body</a>, causing both physical and mental effects. So, if you are experiencing severe depression, you should seek one of the most advanced <a title="Depression Rehab Center in Utah- Pathways Real Life Recovery" href="https://pathwaysreallife.com/depression-treatment-utah/">depression treatment centers Utah</a> offers, where the most up-to-date knowledge is being applied.<br />
<span id="more-5882"></span></p>
<h2>Current Research Provides a New View of Depression</h2>
<p>Depression treatment professionals employ fundamental diagnostic criteria to determine that a patient is experiencing depression. A primary indicator of depression is prolonged (two weeks or longer) sadness or lost interest in activities previously enjoyed. Additional signs and symptoms included in assessments of depression include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sleep problems</li>
<li>Anger, irritability</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
<li>Changes of appetite</li>
<li>Guilt feelings</li>
<li>Weight loss or gain</li>
<li>Anxiety</li>
<li>A sense of worthlessness</li>
<li>Thoughts of suicide</li>
</ul>
<p>There are large amounts of research demonstrating that depression is associated with chemical imbalances in brain regions involved in processing reward. However, based on the clinical diagnostic criteria for depression, it is becoming clearer that depression extends far beyond a mental event only. Symptoms such as weight changes, chronic fatigue, sleep issues, and others are now strongly associated with depression.</p>

<h2>Important Differences Between Mental and Systemic Illness</h2>
<p>The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry published a study analyzing data from nearly 30 other studies of depression and oxidative stress. The researchers’ conclusion emphasized the need to understand depression as a systemic illness, not an exclusively mental illness. This change in the way of categorizing depression may help remove the stigmatization of people with depression. (Having a mental illness is stigmatized in our society significantly more than physical illnesses are.) Some people even hesitate to seek treatment for depression, believing themselves to be simply emotionally or mentally weak, or assume they have been just imagining they have a problem.</p>
<h2>Oxidative Stress and Depression</h2>
<p>The research study found that people suffering from depression have higher than normal levels of “reactive oxygen species.” Those are the unstable residuals of the body’s use of oxygen to generate chemical reactions. In some cases, there are insufficient numbers of antioxidants (the healthy molecules that remove these unstable oxygen species), or the unhealthy oxygen species don’t leave the cell. When that happens, they can cause instability in DNA and cellular damage, which together are called oxidative stress. The research published in the Journal discovered substantially higher amounts of oxidative stress and lower levels of antioxidants in depressed subjects than in the healthy control group. Treatment with antidepressants, which increases the brain’s serotonin in neurotransmitters, had the effect of also reducing oxidative stress levels. The conclusion of the study indicates that depression, once believed to affect only the brain, is actually a disease affecting cells throughout the whole body, stressing them and causing cell damage.</p>
<h2>Effective Help for Depression</h2>
<p>Recognizing depression as a physical illness as well as mental, with multiple potential organs involved, instead of an exclusively mental illness, enables a better understanding of the consequences of the disease and more effective treatment. Medical scientists have already been well aware that depression is associated with an elevated risk of stroke, cardiovascular disease, and the development of serious neurological issues. Add to these potential outcomes, the risk of suicide or drug addiction that often results from the extreme emotional and mental distress of depressed individuals. Researchers now know much more about depression. Their findings are increasingly being applied by the best depression rehab centers, for a more effective treatment that works to alleviate the condition throughout the entire physiological system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Substance abuse and drug addiction are among the biggest problems facing modern society today. Unfortunately, opiate addiction is incredibly common. In a lot of situations, this addiction takes root following prescription medications. Opioid and narcotic drugs are only supposed to be used for short-term conditions. <em><strong>Unfortunately, many people end up relying on them to control chronic pain for prolonged amounts of time. Eventually, people get addicted to them.</strong></em> People may progress from prescription opioid medications to substances that are more deadly. Sadly, opioid overdoses are incredibly common. Why is this the case? What makes them different from other medications?<br />
<span id="more-5869"></span></p>
<h2>People Develop a Tolerance To Opioid Medications Over Time</h2>
<p>If individuals take opioids for a prolonged amount of time, they develop a tolerance to them. Opioid medications function by traveling throughout the body. Then, they bind to specific receptors scattered throughout various systems. Some of the most common locations in which these receptors are found include the spinal cord, the peripheral neurons, and the brain. After an opioid binds to this receptor, the body responds appropriately. For example, opioids may numb people&#8217;s response to pain.</p>
<p>Over time, these receptors are going to change both in how they function and how many of them there are. This is how people develop a tolerance to opioid medications. If people develop a tolerance to opioids, they will have to take more of that specific medication to achieve the same effects. This is called tolerance.</p>
<h2>Tolerance Leads To Opioid Overdoses, Which Can Be Deadly</h2>
<p>There are many reasons people take opioid medications; however, regardless of the reason, opioid addiction can be to tolerance. In individuals who have developed a tolerance to opioid medications, their pain may start to get worse. As a result, they start taking more and more opioids to achieve the same effect.</p>
<p>As people take higher doses of opioids, the chances of overdosing start to go up. Unfortunately, opioid overdoses can be deadly. Opioid medications work in the central nervous system. When people overdose on opioids, this can lead to something called respiratory depression. As a result, people may fall asleep, go unconscious, and they&#8217;re breathing may start to slow. Opioid overdoses cause someone to take low, shallow breaths. This deprives the heart, the brain, and other vital organs of oxygen, which can be fatal. As a result, anyone who has developed a physical dependence on opioid medications should seek the help of trained professionals.</p>
<h2>What Are the Symptoms of Opioid Abuse and Addiction?</h2>
<p>Here are some of the signs and symptoms of opioid misuse and addiction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased resistance for the drug</li>
<li>An inability to quit or minimize usage</li>
<li>withdrawal symptoms when you stop using</li>
<li>a desire to keep using even when health complications</li>
<li>an impact on the quality of life, including relationships and employment</li>
<li>spending excess time and money on drugs</li>
<li>extreme sleeping or excessive weight loss or gain</li>
<li>turning to crime to pay for more opiates</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you know it is important to show gratitude for what you have or provided with? If you are blessed with a perfect family, a good job, stable finances, and a happy life, you should be grateful. Sparing that one minute to thank what you already have is what it takes to make your experience even more joyful.</p>
<p><span id="more-5801"></span></p>
<p>So before we go any further, what exactly does gratitude mean? The word originates from a Latin word gratia. It is the state of being grateful or showing thankfulness. To understand how the power of gratitude works, we are going to look at the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>Gratitude and happiness</li>
<li>Gratitude and health</li>
<li>Gratitude and professional commitment</li>
<li>Neuroscience of gratitude</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gratitude and Happiness</h2>
<p>Gratitude can improve your interpersonal relationship both at home and at work. This can bring you happiness. When you show appreciation to yourself and others, you induce a positive emotion, which is technically happiness. So our overall health and wellbeing are impacted by the feelings of pleasure and contentment derived from gratitude.</p>
<p>According to a study conducted by the British psychologist Robert Holden, 65 percent of people choose happiness over health. However, both are of equal magnitude as far as good health is concerned. So in his study, he concluded that the state of unhappiness is the root of many psychopathological conditions like depression and stress, to mention a few.</p>
<h2>Gratitude and Health</h2>
<p>According to some researches, grateful people are healthy and happy. This is because they have low stress and depression levels, and they can cope better with adversity, and above all, they can sleep better. These people tend to be happier and are likely satisfied with life. So on top of being grateful, keeping a gratitude journal is also beneficial to your health. It reduces the stress level, improves the quality of sleep, and also builds emotional awareness.</p>
<h2>Gratitude and Professional Commitment</h2>
<p>If you want to build your professional commitment, then be grateful. Grateful employees are more efficient, productive, and above all, responsible. Showing gratitude at the workplace imperative in building an interpersonal relationship with colleagues. It can trigger feelings of closeness and bonding. If you are an employee who shows gratitude, then you likely to be loved by others.</p>
<h2>Neuroscience of Gratitude</h2>
<p>According to neuroscience research, there is a link between positive thoughts and activation of certain neurotransmitters. Putting the technicalities aside, if you focus your attention on things you are grateful for, you stimulate neurotransmitters in your brain (dopamine and serotonin) to promote contentment.</p>
<p>The study of neuroscience and gratitude is broad and would probably take a whole chapter just looking at it. What you need to understand is that people have different neurochemicals in their central nervous system, and this is why some are naturally grateful than others. If someone expresses and feels gratitude, it means he or he has more grey matter in their right inferior temporal gyrus.</p>
<p>Now that you understand the benefits of gratitude and its impacts on your life, it would be better to learn how you can practice it. So the question is, how to practice gratitude? The following are a few ways of practicing gratitude.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a gratitude journal.</li>
<li>Show love to someone and tell him or her how much you appreciate them.</li>
<li>Nature the friendship you have</li>
<li>Smile regularly</li>
<li>Spend each day showing kindness</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The act of practicing gratitude, saying <i>thank you </i>to someone who has helped you or saying <i>thank you</i> to the universe for good things that happen, can make you a happier, healthier person. It&#8217;s true. Psychologists at the University of California at Davis and the University of Miami published a paper in 2003 to examine what happens to our bodies when we practice gratitude. The results might surprise you!</p>
<p><span id="more-5790"></span></p>
<h2>The Study About the Neuroscience of Gratitude</h2>
<p><i>The study went like this:</i> subjects in the study were asked to keep a daily journal of the day&#8217;s events. One-third of the subjects were asked to focus on events that made them feel grateful, one-third of subjects were asked to focus on events that had upset them, and one-third of subjects were asked to record information that was neither positive nor negative.</p>
<p><i>Here’s what they discovered:</i> people who spent time examining events that had made them happy were overall happier and healthier than people who didn&#8217;t. People who recorded positive events in their daily journals were more active than people who had not, and went to the doctor fewer times than people who had recorded either negative experiences or neutral experiences in their journals. Overall, people who recorded positive events in their lives also had a more optimistic view of recent events.</p>
<p>Other effects of gratitude include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Reduced feelings of anxiety</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Fewer instances of depression</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Better sleep quality</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Less fatigue</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Reduced inflammation</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Reduced risk of heart failure</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Does Gratitude Positively Impact Your Body?</h2>
<p>Gratitude positively impacts your body by activating the parts of the brain associated with social cognition, moral cognition, value judgment, and reward. In other words, gratitude makes you more supportive of others, and more empathetic.</p>
<p>It also affects metabolism, body temperature, appetite, and sleep. Feelings of gratitude are accompanied by dopamine, which is the hormone associated with pleasure. In some cases, people who practice gratitude are less likely to experience suicidal feelings.</p>
<h2>What Can You Do To Become More Grateful?</h2>
<p>Knowing that feelings of gratitude are good for you, here&#8217;s what you can do to practice gratitude actively in your life.</p>
<h3>Keep a Journal</h3>
<p>Just as those people in that study benefited from writing down their positive experiences, you can too. Keep a journal of positive experiences to make it easier to examine your feelings of gratitude for positive things that have happened throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Reflect When Something Positive Happens</h3>
<p>Think about it when you notice yourself having a happy feeling. Ask yourself why this is something that you are grateful for, and what you might be able to do to repeat the experience.</p>
<h3>Tell Others When Something Good Happens</h3>
<p>When something positive happens to you, tell others about your experience. This makes it easier to remember the good things that have happened to you throughout the day.</p>
